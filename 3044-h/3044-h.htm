      PREFATORY NOTE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following story, the first published by the author, was written
      nineteen years ago, at a time when he was feeling his way to a method. The
      principles observed in its composition are, no doubt, too exclusively
      those in which mystery, entanglement, surprise, and moral obliquity are
      depended on for exciting interest; but some of the scenes, and at least
      one of the characters, have been deemed not unworthy of a little longer
      preservation; and as they could hardly be reproduced in a fragmentary form
      the novel is reissued complete&mdash;the more readily that it has for some
      considerable time been reprinted and widely circulated in America. January
      1889.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the foregoing note I have only to add that, in the present edition of
      'Desperate Remedies,' some Wessex towns and other places that are common
      to the scenes of several of these stories have been called for the first
      time by the names under which they appear elsewhere, for the satisfaction
      of any reader who may care for consistency in such matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the only material change; for, as it happened that certain
      characteristics which provoked most discussion in my latest story were
      present in this my first&mdash;published in 1871, when there was no French
      name for them it has seemed best to let them stand unaltered.
    </p>

    <h2>
      I. THE EVENTS OF THIRTY YEARS
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1. DECEMBER AND JANUARY, 1835-36
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the long and intricately inwrought chain of circumstance which renders
      worthy of record some experiences of Cytherea Graye, Edward Springrove,
      and others, the first event directly influencing the issue was a Christmas
      visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the above-mentioned year, 1835, Ambrose Graye, a young architect who
      had just begun the practice of his profession in the midland town of
      Hocbridge, to the north of Christminster, went to London to spend the
      Christmas holidays with a friend who lived in Bloomsbury. They had gone up
      to Cambridge in the same year, and, after graduating together, Huntway,
      the friend, had taken orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Graye was handsome, frank, and gentle. He had a quality of thought which,
      exercised on homeliness, was humour; on nature, picturesqueness; on
      abstractions, poetry. Being, as a rule, broadcast, it was all three.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the wickedness of the world he was too forgetful. To discover evil in a
      new friend is to most people only an additional experience: to him it was
      ever a surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      While in London he became acquainted with a retired officer in the Navy
      named Bradleigh, who, with his wife and their daughter, lived in a street
      not far from Russell Square. Though they were in no more than comfortable
      circumstances, the captain's wife came of an ancient family whose
      genealogical tree was interlaced with some of the most illustrious and
      well-known in the kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady, their daughter, seemed to Graye by far the most beautiful
      and queenly being he had ever beheld. She was about nineteen or twenty,
      and her name was Cytherea. In truth she was not so very unlike country
      girls of that type of beauty, except in one respect. She was perfect in
      her manner and bearing, and they were not. A mere distinguishing
      peculiarity, by catching the eye, is often read as the pervading
      characteristic, and she appeared to him no less than perfection throughout&mdash;transcending
      her rural rivals in very nature. Graye did a thing the blissfulness of
      which was only eclipsed by its hazardousness. He loved her at first sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      His introductions had led him into contact with Cytherea and her parents
      two or three times on the first week of his arrival in London, and
      accident and a lover's contrivance brought them together as frequently the
      week following. The parents liked young Graye, and having few friends (for
      their equals in blood were their superiors in position), he was received
      on very generous terms. His passion for Cytherea grew not only strong, but
      ineffably exalted: she, without positively encouraging him, tacitly
      assented to his schemes for being near her. Her father and mother seemed
      to have lost all confidence in nobility of birth, without money to give
      effect to its presence, and looked upon the budding consequence of the
      young people's reciprocal glances with placidity, if not actual favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Graye's whole impassioned dream terminated in a sad and unaccountable
      episode. After passing through three weeks of sweet experience, he had
      arrived at the last stage&mdash;a kind of moral Gaza&mdash;before plunging
      into an emotional desert. The second week in January had come round, and
      it was necessary for the young architect to leave town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout his acquaintanceship with the lady of his heart there had been
      this marked peculiarity in her love: she had delighted in his presence as
      a sweetheart should do, yet from first to last she had repressed all
      recognition of the true nature of the thread which drew them together,
      blinding herself to its meaning and only natural tendency, and appearing
      to dread his announcement of them. The present seemed enough for her
      without cumulative hope: usually, even if love is in itself an end, it
      must be regarded as a beginning to be enjoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of evasions as an obstacle, and in consequence of them as a spur,
      he would put the matter off no longer. It was evening. He took her into a
      little conservatory on the landing, and there among the evergreens, by the
      light of a few tiny lamps, infinitely enhancing the freshness and beauty
      of the leaves, he made the declaration of a love as fresh and beautiful as
      they.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My love&mdash;my darling, be my wife!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed like one just awakened. 'Ah&mdash;we must part now!' she
      faltered, in a voice of anguish. 'I will write to you.' She loosened her
      hand and rushed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a wild fever Graye went home and watched for the next morning. Who
      shall express his misery and wonder when a note containing these words was
      put into his hand?
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good-bye; good-bye for ever. As recognized lovers something divides us
      eternally. Forgive me&mdash;I should have told you before; but your love
      was sweet! Never mention me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      That very day, and as it seemed, to put an end to a painful condition of
      things, daughter and parents left London to pay off a promised visit to a
      relative in a western county. No message or letter of entreaty could wring
      from her any explanation. She begged him not to follow her, and the most
      bewildering point was that her father and mother appeared, from the tone
      of a letter Graye received from them, as vexed and sad as he at this
      sudden renunciation. One thing was plain: without admitting her reason as
      valid, they knew what that reason was, and did not intend to reveal it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week from that day Ambrose Graye left his friend Huntway's house and saw
      no more of the Love he mourned. From time to time his friend answered any
      inquiry Graye made by letter respecting her. But very poor food to a lover
      is intelligence of a mistress filtered through a friend. Huntway could
      tell nothing definitely. He said he believed there had been some prior
      flirtation between Cytherea and her cousin, an officer of the line, two or
      three years before Graye met her, which had suddenly been terminated by
      the cousin's departure for India, and the young lady's travelling on the
      Continent with her parents the whole of the ensuing summer, on account of
      delicate health. Eventually Huntway said that circumstances had rendered
      Graye's attachment more hopeless still. Cytherea's mother had unexpectedly
      inherited a large fortune and estates in the west of England by the rapid
      fall of some intervening lives. This had caused their removal from the
      small house in Bloomsbury, and, as it appeared, a renunciation of their
      old friends in that quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Graye concluded that his Cytherea had forgotten him and his love.
      But he could not forget her.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. FROM 1843 TO 1861
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight years later, feeling lonely and depressed&mdash;a man without
      relatives, with many acquaintances but no friends&mdash;Ambrose Graye met
      a young lady of a different kind, fairly endowed with money and good
      gifts. As to caring very deeply for another woman after the loss of
      Cytherea, it was an absolute impossibility with him. With all, the
      beautiful things of the earth become more dear as they elude pursuit; but
      with some natures utter elusion is the one special event which will make a
      passing love permanent for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      This second young lady and Graye were married. That he did not, first or
      last, love his wife as he should have done, was known to all; but few knew
      that his unmanageable heart could never be weaned from useless repining at
      the loss of its first idol.
    </p>
    <p>
      His character to some extent deteriorated, as emotional constitutions will
      under the long sense of disappointment at having missed their imagined
      destiny. And thus, though naturally of a gentle and pleasant disposition,
      he grew to be not so tenderly regarded by his acquaintances as it is the
      lot of some of those persons to be. The winning and sanguine receptivity
      of his early life developed by degrees a moody nervousness, and when not
      picturing prospects drawn from baseless hope he was the victim of
      indescribable depression. The practical issue of such a condition was
      improvidence, originally almost an unconscious improvidence, for every
      debt incurred had been mentally paid off with a religious exactness from
      the treasures of expectation before mentioned. But as years revolved, the
      same course was continued from the lack of spirit sufficient for shifting
      out of an old groove when it has been found to lead to disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year 1861 his wife died, leaving him a widower with two children.
      The elder, a son named Owen, now just turned seventeen, was taken from
      school, and initiated as pupil to the profession of architect in his
      father's office. The remaining child was a daughter, and Owen's junior by
      a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her christian name was Cytherea, and it is easy to guess why.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. OCTOBER THE TWELFTH, 1863
    </p>
    <p>
      We pass over two years in order to reach the next cardinal event of these
      persons' lives. The scene is still the Grayes' native town of Hocbridge,
      but as it appeared on a Monday afternoon in the month of October.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather was sunny and dry, but the ancient borough was to be seen
      wearing one of its least attractive aspects. First on account of the time.
      It was that stagnant hour of the twenty-four when the practical garishness
      of Day, having escaped from the fresh long shadows and enlivening newness
      of the morning, has not yet made any perceptible advance towards acquiring
      those mellow and soothing tones which grace its decline. Next, it was that
      stage in the progress of the week when business&mdash;which, carried on
      under the gables of an old country place, is not devoid of a romantic
      sparkle&mdash;was well-nigh extinguished. Lastly, the town was
      intentionally bent upon being attractive by exhibiting to an influx of
      visitors the local talent for dramatic recitation, and provincial towns
      trying to be lively are the dullest of dull things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little towns are like little children in this respect, that they interest
      most when they are enacting native peculiarities unconscious of beholders.
      Discovering themselves to be watched they attempt to be entertaining by
      putting on an antic, and produce disagreeable caricatures which spoil
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather-stained clock-face in the low church tower standing at the
      intersection of the three chief streets was expressing half-past two to
      the Town Hall opposite, where the much talked-of reading from Shakespeare
      was about to begin. The doors were open, and those persons who had already
      assembled within the building were noticing the entrance of the new-comers&mdash;silently
      criticizing their dress&mdash;questioning the genuineness of their teeth
      and hair&mdash;estimating their private means.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among these later ones came an exceptional young maiden who glowed amid
      the dulness like a single bright-red poppy in a field of brown stubble.
      She wore an elegant dark jacket, lavender dress, hat with grey strings and
      trimmings, and gloves of a colour to harmonize. She lightly walked up the
      side passage of the room, cast a slight glance around, and entered the
      seat pointed out to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl was Cytherea Graye; her age was now about eighteen. During
      her entry, and at various times whilst sitting in her seat and listening
      to the reader on the platform, her personal appearance formed an
      interesting subject of study for several neighbouring eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face was exceedingly attractive, though artistically less perfect than
      her figure, which approached unusually near to the standard of
      faultlessness. But even this feature of hers yielded the palm to the
      gracefulness of her movement, which was fascinating and delightful to an
      extreme degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, motion was her speciality, whether shown on its most extended
      scale of bodily progression, or minutely, as in the uplifting of her
      eyelids, the bending of her fingers, the pouting of her lip. The carriage
      of her head&mdash;motion within motion&mdash;a glide upon a glide&mdash;was
      as delicate as that of a magnetic needle. And this flexibility and
      elasticity had never been taught her by rule, nor even been acquired by
      observation, but, nullo cultu, had naturally developed itself with her
      years. In childhood, a stone or stalk in the way, which had been the
      inevitable occasion of a fall to her playmates, had usually left her safe
      and upright on her feet after the narrowest escape by oscillations and
      whirls for the preservation of her balance. At mixed Christmas parties,
      when she numbered but twelve or thirteen years, and was heartily despised
      on that account by lads who deemed themselves men, her apt lightness in
      the dance covered this incompleteness in her womanhood, and compelled the
      self-same youths in spite of resolutions to seize upon her childish figure
      as a partner whom they could not afford to contemn. And in later years,
      when the instincts of her sex had shown her this point as the best and
      rarest feature in her external self, she was not found wanting in
      attention to the cultivation of finish in its details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hair rested gaily upon her shoulders in curls and was of a shining
      corn yellow in the high lights, deepening to a definite nut-brown as each
      curl wound round into the shade. She had eyes of a sapphire hue, though
      rather darker than the gem ordinarily appears; they possessed the
      affectionate and liquid sparkle of loyalty and good faith as
      distinguishable from that harder brightness which seems to express
      faithfulness only to the object confronting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to attempt to gain a view of her&mdash;or indeed of any fascinating
      woman&mdash;from a measured category, is as difficult as to appreciate the
      effect of a landscape by exploring it at night with a lantern&mdash;or of
      a full chord of music by piping the notes in succession. Nevertheless it
      may readily be believed from the description here ventured, that among the
      many winning phases of her aspect, these were particularly striking:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  During pleasant doubt, when her eyes brightened stealthily and
  smiled (as eyes will smile) as distinctly as her lips, and in the
  space of a single instant expressed clearly the whole round of
  degrees of expectancy which lie over the wide expanse between Yea
  and Nay.

  During the telling of a secret, which was involuntarily
  accompanied by a sudden minute start, and ecstatic pressure of
  the listener's arm, side, or neck, as the position and degree
  of intimacy dictated.

  When anxiously regarding one who possessed her affections.
</pre>
    <p>
      She suddenly assumed the last-mentioned bearing in the progress of the
      present entertainment. Her glance was directed out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why the particulars of a young lady's presence at a very mediocre
      performance were prevented from dropping into the oblivion which their
      intrinsic insignificance would naturally have involved&mdash;why they were
      remembered and individualized by herself and others through after years&mdash;was
      simply that she unknowingly stood, as it were, upon the extreme posterior
      edge of a tract in her life, in which the real meaning of Taking Thought
      had never been known. It was the last hour of experience she ever enjoyed
      with a mind entirely free from a knowledge of that labyrinth into which
      she stepped immediately afterwards&mdash;to continue a perplexed course
      along its mazes for the greater portion of twenty-nine subsequent months.

    <p>
      The Town Hall, in which Cytherea sat, was a building of brown stone, and
      through one of the windows could be seen from the interior of the room the
      housetops and chimneys of the adjacent street, and also the upper part of
      a neighbouring church spire, now in course of completion under the
      superintendence of Miss Graye's father, the architect to the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      That the top of this spire should be visible from her position in the room
      was a fact which Cytherea's idling eyes had discovered with some interest,
      and she was now engaged in watching the scene that was being enacted about
      its airy summit. Round the conical stonework rose a cage of scaffolding
      against the blue sky, and upon this stood five men&mdash;four in clothes
      as white as the new erection close beneath their hands, the fifth in the
      ordinary dark suit of a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four working-men in white were three masons and a mason's labourer.
      The fifth man was the architect, Mr. Graye. He had been giving directions
      as it seemed, and retiring as far as the narrow footway allowed, stood
      perfectly still.
    </p>
    <p>
      The picture thus presented to a spectator in the Town Hall was curious and
      striking. It was an illuminated miniature, framed in by the dark margin of
      the window, the keen-edged shadiness of which emphasized by contrast the
      softness of the objects enclosed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The height of the spire was about one hundred and twenty feet, and the
      five men engaged thereon seemed entirely removed from the sphere and
      experiences of ordinary human beings. They appeared little larger than
      pigeons, and made their tiny movements with a soft, spirit-like
      silentness. One idea above all others was conveyed to the mind of a person
      on the ground by their aspect, namely, concentration of purpose: that they
      were indifferent to&mdash;even unconscious of&mdash;the distracted world
      beneath them, and all that moved upon it. They never looked off the
      scaffolding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then one of them turned; it was Mr. Graye. Again he stood motionless, with
      attention to the operations of the others. He appeared to be lost in
      reflection, and had directed his face towards a new stone they were
      lifting.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why does he stand like that?' the young lady thought at length&mdash;up
      to that moment as listless and careless as one of the ancient Tarentines,
      who, on such an afternoon as this, watched from the Theatre the entry into
      their Harbour of a power that overturned the State.
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved herself uneasily. 'I wish he would come down,' she whispered,
      still gazing at the skybacked picture. 'It is so dangerous to be
      absent-minded up there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had done murmuring the words her father indecisively laid hold of
      one of the scaffold-poles, as if to test its strength, then let it go and
      stepped back. In stepping, his foot slipped. An instant of doubling
      forward and sideways, and he reeled off into the air, immediately
      disappearing downwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      His agonized daughter rose to her feet by a convulsive movement. Her lips
      parted, and she gasped for breath. She could utter no sound. One by one
      the people about her, unconscious of what had happened, turned their
      heads, and inquiry and alarm became visible upon their faces at the sight
      of the poor child. A moment longer, and she fell to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next impression of which Cytherea had any consciousness was of being
      carried from a strange vehicle across the pavement to the steps of her own
      house by her brother and an older man. Recollection of what had passed
      evolved itself an instant later, and just as they entered the door&mdash;through
      which another and sadder burden had been carried but a few instants before&mdash;her
      eyes caught sight of the south-western sky, and, without heeding, saw
      white sunlight shining in shaft-like lines from a rift in a slaty cloud.
      Emotions will attach themselves to scenes that are simultaneous&mdash;however
      foreign in essence these scenes may be&mdash;as chemical waters will
      crystallize on twigs and wires. Even after that time any mental agony
      brought less vividly to Cytherea's mind the scene from the Town Hall
      windows than sunlight streaming in shaft-like lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. OCTOBER THE NINETEENTH
    </p>
    <p>
      When death enters a house, an element of sadness and an element of horror
      accompany it. Sadness, from the death itself: horror, from the clouds of
      blackness we designedly labour to introduce.
    </p>
    <p>
      The funeral had taken place. Depressed, yet resolved in his demeanour,
      Owen Graye sat before his father's private escritoire, engaged in turning
      out and unfolding a heterogeneous collection of papers&mdash;forbidding
      and inharmonious to the eye at all times&mdash;most of all to one under
      the influence of a great grief. Laminae of white paper tied with twine
      were indiscriminately intermixed with other white papers bounded by black
      edges&mdash;these with blue foolscap wrapped round with crude red tape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bulk of these letters, bills, and other documents were submitted to a
      careful examination, by which the appended particulars were ascertained:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  First, that their father's income from professional sources had
  been very small, amounting to not more than half their expenditure;
  and that his own and his wife's property, upon which he had relied
  for the balance, had been sunk and lost in unwise loans to
  unscrupulous men, who had traded upon their father's too
  open-hearted trustfulness.

  Second, that finding his mistake, he had endeavoured to regain
  his standing by the illusory path of speculation. The most notable
  instance of this was the following. He had been induced, when at
  Plymouth in the autumn of the previous year, to venture all his
  spare capital on the bottomry security of an Italian brig which
  had put into the harbour in distress. The profit was to be
  considerable, so was the risk. There turned out to be no security
  whatever. The circumstances of the case tendered it the most
  unfortunate speculation that a man like himself&mdash;ignorant of all
  such matters&mdash;could possibly engage in. The vessel went down, and
  all Mr. Graye's money with it.

  Third, that these failures had left him burdened with debts he
  knew not how to meet; so that at the time of his death even the few
  pounds lying to his account at the bank were his only in name.

  Fourth, that the loss of his wife two years earlier had
  awakened him to a keen sense of his blindness, and of his duty by
  his children. He had then resolved to reinstate by unflagging zeal
  in the pursuit of his profession, and by no speculation, at least a
  portion of the little fortune he had let go.
</pre>
    <p>
      Cytherea was frequently at her brother's elbow during these examinations.
      She often remarked sadly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Poor papa failed to fulfil his good intention for want of time, didn't
      he, Owen? And there was an excuse for his past, though he never would
      claim it. I never forget that original disheartening blow, and how that
      from it sprang all the ills of his life&mdash;everything connected with
      his gloom, and the lassitude in business we used so often to see about
      him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I remember what he said once,' returned the brother, 'when I sat up late
      with him. He said, "Owen, don't love too blindly: blindly you will love if
      you love at all, but a little care is still possible to a well-disciplined
      heart. May that heart be yours as it was not mine," father said.
      "Cultivate the art of renunciation." And I am going to, Cytherea.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And once mamma said that an excellent woman was papa's ruin, because he
      did not know the way to give her up when he had lost her. I wonder where
      she is now, Owen? We were told not to try to find out anything about her.
      Papa never told us her name, did he?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That was by her own request, I believe. But never mind her; she was not
      our mother.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The love affair which had been Ambrose Graye's disheartening blow was
      precisely of that nature which lads take little account of, but girls
      ponder in their hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. FROM OCTOBER THE NINETEENTH TO JULY THE NINTH
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Ambrose Graye's good intentions with regard to the reintegration of
      his property had scarcely taken tangible form when his sudden death put
      them for ever out of his power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heavy bills, showing the extent of his obligations, tumbled in immediately
      upon the heels of the funeral from quarters previously unheard and
      unthought of. Thus pressed, a bill was filed in Chancery to have the
      assets, such as they were, administered by the Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What will become of us now?' thought Owen continually.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is in us an unquenchable expectation, which at the gloomiest time
      persists in inferring that because we are <i>ourselves</i>, there must be
      a special future in store for us, though our nature and antecedents to the
      remotest particular have been common to thousands. Thus to Cytherea and
      Owen Graye the question how their lives would end seemed the deepest of
      possible enigmas. To others who knew their position equally well with
      themselves the question was the easiest that could be asked&mdash;'Like
      those of other people similarly circumstanced.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Owen held a consultation with his sister to come to some decision on
      their future course, and a month was passed in waiting for answers to
      letters, and in the examination of schemes more or less futile. Sudden
      hopes that were rainbows to the sight proved but mists to the touch. In
      the meantime, unpleasant remarks, disguise them as some well-meaning
      people might, were floating around them every day. The undoubted truth,
      that they were the children of a dreamer who let slip away every farthing
      of his money and ran into debt with his neighbours&mdash;that the daughter
      had been brought up to no profession&mdash;that the son who had, had made
      no progress in it, and might come to the dogs&mdash;could not from the
      nature of things be wrapped up in silence in order that it might not hurt
      their feelings; and as a matter of fact, it greeted their ears in some
      form or other wherever they went. Their few acquaintances passed them
      hurriedly. Ancient pot-wallopers, and thriving shopkeepers, in their
      intervals of leisure, stood at their shop-doors&mdash;their toes hanging
      over the edge of the step, and their obese waists hanging over their toes&mdash;and
      in discourses with friends on the pavement, formulated the course of the
      improvident, and reduced the children's prospects to a shadow-like
      attenuation. The sons of these men (who wore breastpins of a sarcastic
      kind, and smoked humorous pipes) stared at Cytherea with a stare
      unmitigated by any of the respect that had formerly softened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it is a noticeable fact that we do not much mind what men think of us,
      or what humiliating secret they discover of our means, parentage, or
      object, provided that each thinks and acts thereupon in isolation. It is
      the exchange of ideas about us that we dread most; and the possession by a
      hundred acquaintances, severally insulated, of the knowledge of our
      skeleton-closet's whereabouts, is not so distressing to the nerves as a
      chat over it by a party of half-a-dozen&mdash;exclusive depositaries
      though these may be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps, though Hocbridge watched and whispered, its animus would have
      been little more than a trifle to persons in thriving circumstances. But
      unfortunately, poverty, whilst it is new, and before the skin has had time
      to thicken, makes people susceptible inversely to their opportunities for
      shielding themselves. In Owen was found, in place of his father's
      impressibility, a larger share of his father's pride, and a squareness of
      idea which, if coupled with a little more blindness, would have amounted
      to positive prejudice. To him humanity, so far as he had thought of it at
      all, was rather divided into distinct classes than blended from extreme to
      extreme. Hence by a sequence of ideas which might be traced if it were
      worth while, he either detested or respected opinion, and instinctively
      sought to escape a cold shade that mere sensitiveness would have endured.
      He could have submitted to separation, sickness, exile, drudgery, hunger
      and thirst, with stoical indifference, but superciliousness was too
      incisive.
    </p>
    <p>
      After living on for nine months in attempts to make an income as his
      father's successor in the profession&mdash;attempts which were utterly
      fruitless by reason of his inexperience&mdash;Graye came to a simple and
      sweeping resolution. They would privately leave that part of England, drop
      from the sight of acquaintances, gossips, harsh critics, and bitter
      creditors of whose misfortune he was not the cause, and escape the
      position which galled him by the only road their great poverty left open
      to them&mdash;that of his obtaining some employment in a distant place by
      following his profession as a humble under-draughtsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought over his capabilities with the sensations of a soldier grinding
      his sword at the opening of a campaign. What with lack of employment,
      owing to the decrease of his late father's practice, and the absence of
      direct and uncompromising pressure towards monetary results from a pupil's
      labour (which seems to be always the case when a professional man's pupil
      is also his son), Owen's progress in the art and science of architecture
      had been very insignificant indeed. Though anything but an idle young man,
      he had hardly reached the age at which industrious men who lack an
      external whip to send them on in the world, are induced by their own
      common sense to whip on themselves. Hence his knowledge of plans,
      elevations, sections, and specifications, was not greater at the end of
      two years of probation than might easily have been acquired in six months
      by a youth of average ability&mdash;himself, for instance&mdash;amid a
      bustling London practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at any rate he could make himself handy to one of the profession&mdash;some
      man in a remote town&mdash;and there fulfil his indentures. A tangible
      inducement lay in this direction of survey. He had a slight conception of
      such a man&mdash;a Mr. Gradfield&mdash;who was in practice in Budmouth
      Regis, a seaport town and watering-place in the south of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some doubts, Graye ventured to write to this gentleman, asking the
      necessary question, shortly alluding to his father's death, and stating
      that his term of apprenticeship had only half expired. He would be glad to
      complete his articles at a very low salary for the whole remaining two
      years, provided payment could begin at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer from Mr. Gradfield stated that he was not in want of a pupil
      who would serve the remainder of his time on the terms Mr. Graye
      mentioned. But he would just add one remark. He chanced to be in want of
      some young man in his office&mdash;for a short time only, probably about
      two months&mdash;to trace drawings, and attend to other subsidiary work of
      the kind. If Mr. Graye did not object to occupy such an inferior position
      as these duties would entail, and to accept weekly wages which to one with
      his expectations would be considered merely nominal, the post would give
      him an opportunity for learning a few more details of the profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is a beginning, and, above all, an abiding-place, away from the shadow
      of the cloud which hangs over us here&mdash;I will go,' said Owen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea's plan for her future, an intensely simple one, owing to the even
      greater narrowness of her resources, was already marked out. One advantage
      had accrued to her through her mother's possession of a fair share of
      personal property, and perhaps only one. She had been carefully educated.
      Upon this consideration her plan was based. She was to take up her abode
      in her brother's lodging at Budmouth, when she would immediately advertise
      for a situation as governess, having obtained the consent of a lawyer at
      Aldbrickham who was winding up her father's affairs, and who knew the
      history of her position, to allow himself to be referred to in the matter
      of her past life and respectability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early one morning they departed from their native town, leaving behind
      them scarcely a trace of their footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the town pitied their want of wisdom in taking such a step.
      'Rashness; they would have made a better income in Hocbridge, where they
      are known! There is no doubt that they would.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But what is Wisdom really? A steady handling of any means to bring about
      any end necessary to happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet whether one's end be the usual end&mdash;a wealthy position in life&mdash;or
      no, the name of wisdom is seldom applied but to the means to that usual
      end.

      II. THE EVENTS OF A FORTNIGHT
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1. THE NINTH OF JULY
    </h3>
    <p>
      The day of their departure was one of the most glowing that the climax of
      a long series of summer heats could evolve. The wide expanse of landscape
      quivered up and down like the flame of a taper, as they steamed along
      through the midst of it. Placid flocks of sheep reclining under trees a
      little way off appeared of a pale blue colour. Clover fields were livid
      with the brightness of the sun upon their deep red flowers. All waggons
      and carts were moved to the shade by their careful owners, rain-water
      butts fell to pieces; well-buckets were lowered inside the covers of the
      well-hole, to preserve them from the fate of the butts, and generally,
      water seemed scarcer in the country than the beer and cider of the
      peasantry who toiled or idled there.
    </p>
    <p>
      To see persons looking with children's eyes at any ordinary scenery, is a
      proof that they possess the charming faculty of drawing new sensations
      from an old experience&mdash;a healthy sign, rare in these feverish days&mdash;the
      mark of an imperishable brightness of nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both brother and sister could do this; Cytherea more noticeably. They
      watched the undulating corn-lands, monotonous to all their companions; the
      stony and clayey prospect succeeding those, with its angular and abrupt
      hills. Boggy moors came next, now withered and dry&mdash;the spots upon
      which pools usually spread their waters showing themselves as circles of
      smooth bare soil, over-run by a net-work of innumerable little fissures.
      Then arose plantations of firs, abruptly terminating beside meadows
      cleanly mown, in which high-hipped, rich-coloured cows, with backs
      horizontal and straight as the ridge of a house, stood motionless or
      lazily fed. Glimpses of the sea now interested them, which became more and
      more frequent till the train finally drew up beside the platform at
      Budmouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The whole town is looking out for us,' had been Graye's impression
      throughout the day. He called upon Mr. Gradfield&mdash;the only man who
      had been directly informed of his coming&mdash;and found that Mr.
      Gradfield had forgotten it.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, arrangements were made with this gentleman&mdash;a stout, active,
      grey-bearded burgher of sixty&mdash;by which Owen was to commence work in
      his office the following week.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same day Cytherea drew up and sent off the advertisement appended:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  'A YOUNG LADY is desirous of meeting with an <i>engagement</i> as
  <i>governess</i> or <i>companion</i>. She is competent to teach English,
  French, and Music. Satisfactory references&mdash;Address, C. G.,
  Post-Office, Budmouth.'
</pre>
    <p>
      It seemed a more material existence than her own that she saw thus
      delineated on the paper. 'That can't be myself; how odd I look!' she said,
      and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. JULY THE ELEVENTH
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Monday subsequent to their arrival in Budmouth, Owen Graye attended
      at Mr. Gradfield's office to enter upon his duties, and his sister was
      left in their lodgings alone for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the sad occurrences of the preceding autumn, an unwonted
      cheerfulness pervaded her spirit throughout the day. Change of scene&mdash;and
      that to untravelled eyes&mdash;conjoined with the sensation of freedom
      from supervision, revived the sparkle of a warm young nature ready enough
      to take advantage of any adventitious restoratives. Point-blank grief
      tends rather to seal up happiness for a time than to produce that
      attrition which results from griefs of anticipation that move onward with
      the days: these may be said to furrow away the capacity for pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her expectations from the advertisement began to be extravagant. A
      thriving family, who had always sadly needed her, was already definitely
      pictured in her fancy, which, in its exuberance, led her on to picturing
      its individual members, their possible peculiarities, virtues, and vices,
      and obliterated for a time the recollection that she would be separated
      from her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus musing, as she waited for his return in the evening, her eyes fell on
      her left hand. The contemplation of her own left fourth finger by
      symbol-loving girlhood of this age is, it seems, very frequently, if not
      always, followed by a peculiar train of romantic ideas. Cytherea's
      thoughts, still playing about her future, became directed into this
      romantic groove. She leant back in her chair, and taking hold of the
      fourth finger, which had attracted her attention, she lifted it with the
      tips of the others, and looked at the smooth and tapering member for a
      long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      She whispered idly, 'I wonder who and what he will be?
    </p>
    <p>
      'If he's a gentleman of fashion, he will take my finger so, just with the
      tips of his own, and with some fluttering of the heart, and the least
      trembling of his lip, slip the ring so lightly on that I shall hardly know
      it is there&mdash;looking delightfully into my eyes all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If he's a bold, dashing soldier, I expect he will proudly turn round,
      take the ring as if it equalled her Majesty's crown in value, and
      desperately set it on my finger thus. He will fix his eyes unflinchingly
      upon what he is doing&mdash;just as if he stood in battle before the enemy
      (though, in reality, very fond of me, of course), and blush as much as I
      shall.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If he's a sailor, he will take my finger and the ring in this way, and
      deck it out with a housewifely touch and a tenderness of expression about
      his mouth, as sailors do: kiss it, perhaps, with a simple air, as if we
      were children playing an idle game, and not at the very height of
      observation and envy by a great crowd saying, "Ah! they are happy now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      'If he should be rather a poor man&mdash;noble-minded and affectionate,
      but still poor&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen's footsteps rapidly ascending the stairs, interrupted this fancy-free
      meditation. Reproaching herself, even angry with herself for allowing her
      mind to stray upon such subjects in the face of their present desperate
      condition, she rose to meet him, and make tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea's interest to know how her brother had been received at Mr.
      Gradfield's broke forth into words at once. Almost before they had sat
      down to table, she began cross-examining him in the regular sisterly way.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, Owen, how has it been with you to-day? What is the place like&mdash;do
      you think you will like Mr. Gradfield?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes. But he has not been there to-day; I have only had the head
      draughtsman with me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Young women have a habit, not noticeable in men, of putting on at a
      moment's notice the drama of whosoever's life they choose. Cytherea's
      interest was transferred from Mr. Gradfield to his representative.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What sort of a man is he?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He seems a very nice fellow indeed; though of course I can hardly tell to
      a certainty as yet. But I think he's a very worthy fellow; there's no
      nonsense in him, and though he is not a public school man he has read
      widely, and has a sharp appreciation of what's good in books and art. In
      fact, his knowledge isn't nearly so exclusive as most professional men's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's a great deal to say of an architect, for of all professional men
      they are, as a rule, the most professional.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; perhaps they are. This man is rather of a melancholy turn of mind, I
      think.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Has the managing clerk any family?' she mildly asked, after a while,
      pouring out some more tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Family; no!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, dear Owen, how should I know?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, of course he isn't married. But there happened to be a conversation
      about women going on in the office, and I heard him say what he should
      wish his wife to be like.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What would he wish his wife to be like?' she said, with great apparent
      lack of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, he says she must be girlish and artless: yet he would be loth to do
      without a dash of womanly subtlety, 'tis so piquant. Yes, he said, that
      must be in her; she must have womanly cleverness. "And yet I should like
      her to blush if only a cock-sparrow were to look at her hard," he said,
      "which brings me back to the girl again: and so I flit backwards and
      forwards. I must have what comes, I suppose," he said, "and whatever she
      may be, thank God she's no worse. However, if he might give a final hint
      to Providence," he said, "a child among pleasures, and a woman among pains
      was the rough outline of his requirement."'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did he say that? What a musing creature he must be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He did, indeed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      3. FROM THE TWELFTH TO THE FIFTEENTH OF JULY
    </p>
    <p>
      As is well known, ideas are so elastic in a human brain, that they have no
      constant measure which may be called their actual bulk. Any important idea
      may be compressed to a molecule by an unwonted crowding of others; and any
      small idea will expand to whatever length and breadth of vacuum the mind
      may be able to make over to it. Cytherea's world was tolerably vacant at
      this time, and the young architectural designer's image became very
      pervasive. The next evening this subject was again renewed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'His name is Springrove,' said Owen, in reply to her. 'He is a thorough
      artist, but a man of rather humble origin, it seems, who has made himself
      so far. I think he is the son of a farmer, or something of the kind.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, he's none the worse for that, I suppose.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'None the worse. As we come down the hill, we shall be continually meeting
      people going up.' But Owen had felt that Springrove was a little the worse
      nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course he's rather old by this time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no. He's about six-and-twenty&mdash;not more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, I see.... What is he like, Owen?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't exactly tell you his appearance: 'tis always such a difficult
      thing to do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A man you would describe as short? Most men are those we should describe
      as short, I fancy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should call him, I think, of the middle height; but as I only see him
      sitting in the office, of course I am not certain about his form and
      figure.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wish you were, then.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps you do. But I am not, you see.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course not, you are always so provoking. Owen, I saw a man in the
      street to-day whom I fancied was he&mdash;and yet, I don't see how it
      could be, either. He had light brown hair, a snub nose, very round face,
      and a peculiar habit of reducing his eyes to straight lines when he looked
      narrowly at anything.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no. That was not he, Cytherea.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not a bit like him in all probability.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not a bit. He has dark hair&mdash;almost a Grecian nose, regular teeth,
      and an intellectual face, as nearly as I can recall to mind.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, there now, Owen, you <i>have</i> described him! But I suppose he's
      not generally called pleasing, or&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Handsome?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I scarcely meant that. But since you have said it, is he handsome?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Rather.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'His tout ensemble is striking?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes&mdash;O no, no&mdash;I forgot: it is not. He is rather untidy in his
      waistcoat, and neck-ties, and hair.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How vexing!... it must be to himself, poor thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's a thorough bookworm&mdash;despises the pap-and-daisy school of verse&mdash;knows
      Shakespeare to the very dregs of the foot-notes. Indeed, he's a poet
      himself in a small way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How delicious!' she said. 'I have never known a poet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you don't know him,' said Owen dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She reddened. 'Of course I don't. I know that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have you received any answer to your advertisement?' he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah&mdash;no!' she said, and the forgotten disappointment which had showed
      itself in her face at different times during the day, became visible
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another day passed away. On Thursday, without inquiry, she learnt more of
      the head draughtsman. He and Graye had become very friendly, and he had
      been tempted to show her brother a copy of some poems of his&mdash;some
      serious and sad&mdash;some humorous&mdash;which had appeared in the poets'
      corner of a magazine from time to time. Owen showed them now to Cytherea,
      who instantly began to read them carefully and to think them very
      beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes&mdash;Springrove's no fool,' said Owen sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No fool!&mdash;I should think he isn't, indeed,' said Cytherea, looking
      up from the paper in quite an excitement: 'to write such verses as these!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What logic are you chopping, Cytherea? Well, I don't mean on account of
      the verses, because I haven't read them; but for what he said when the
      fellows were talking about falling in love.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Which you will tell me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He says that your true lover breathlessly finds himself engaged to a
      sweetheart, like a man who has caught something in the dark. He doesn't
      know whether it is a bat or a bird, and takes it to the light when he is
      cool to learn what it is. He looks to see if she is the right age, but
      right age or wrong age, he must consider her a prize. Sometime later he
      ponders whether she is the right kind of prize for him. Right kind or
      wrong kind&mdash;he has called her his, and must abide by it. After a time
      he asks himself, "Has she the temper, hair, and eyes I meant to have, and
      was firmly resolved not to do without?" He finds it is all wrong, and then
      comes the tussle&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do they marry and live happily?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who? O, the supposed pair. I think he said&mdash;well, I really forget
      what he said.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That <i>is</i> stupid of you!' said the young lady with dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But he's a satirist&mdash;I don't think I care about him now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There you are just wrong. He is not. He is, as I believe, an impulsive
      fellow who has been made to pay the penalty of his rashness in some love
      affair.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus ended the dialogue of Thursday, but Cytherea read the verses again in
      private. On Friday her brother remarked that Springrove had informed him
      he was going to leave Mr. Gradfield's in a fortnight to push his fortunes
      in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      An indescribable feeling of sadness shot through Cytherea's heart. Why
      should she be sad at such an announcement as that, she thought, concerning
      a man she had never seen, when her spirits were elastic enough to rebound
      after hard blows from deep and real troubles as if she had scarcely known
      them? Though she could not answer this question, she knew one thing, she
      was saddened by Owen's news.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. JULY THE TWENTY-FIRST
    </p>
    <p>
      A very popular local excursion by steamboat to Lulstead Cove was announced
      through the streets of Budmouth one Thursday morning by the weak-voiced
      town-crier, to start at six o'clock the same day. The weather was lovely,
      and the opportunity being the first of the kind offered to them, Owen and
      Cytherea went with the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had reached the Cove, and had walked landward for nearly an hour over
      the hill which rose beside the strand, when Graye recollected that two or
      three miles yet further inland from this spot was an interesting mediaeval
      ruin. He was already familiar with its characteristics through the medium
      of an archaeological work, and now finding himself so close to the
      reality, felt inclined to verify some theory he had formed respecting it.
      Concluding that there would be just sufficient time for him to go there
      and return before the boat had left the shore, he parted from Cytherea on
      the hill, struck downwards, and then up a heathery valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remained on the summit where he had left her till the time of his
      expected return, scanning the details of the prospect around. Placidly
      spread out before her on the south was the open Channel, reflecting a blue
      intenser by many shades than that of the sky overhead, and dotted in the
      foreground by half-a-dozen small craft of contrasting rig, their sails
      graduating in hue from extreme whiteness to reddish brown, the varying
      actual colours varied again in a double degree by the rays of the
      declining sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the distant bell from the boat was heard, warning the passengers
      to embark. This was followed by a lively air from the harps and violins on
      board, their tones, as they arose, becoming intermingled with, though not
      marred by, the brush of the waves when their crests rolled over&mdash;at
      the point where the check of the shallows was first felt&mdash;and then
      thinned away up the slope of pebbles and sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her face landward and strained her eyes to discern, if
      possible, some sign of Owen's return. Nothing was visible save the
      strikingly brilliant, still landscape. The wide concave which lay at the
      back of the hill in this direction was blazing with the western light,
      adding an orange tint to the vivid purple of the heather, now at the very
      climax of bloom, and free from the slightest touch of the invidious brown
      that so soon creeps into its shades. The light so intensified the colours
      that they seemed to stand above the surface of the earth and float in
      mid-air like an exhalation of red. In the minor valleys, between the
      hillocks and ridges which diversified the contour of the basin, but did
      not disturb its general sweep, she marked brakes of tall, heavy-stemmed
      ferns, five or six feet high, in a brilliant light-green dress&mdash;a
      broad riband of them with the path in their midst winding like a stream
      along the little ravine that reached to the foot of the hill, and
      delivered up the path to its grassy area. Among the ferns grew holly
      bushes deeper in tint than any shadow about them, whilst the whole surface
      of the scene was dimpled with small conical pits, and here and there were
      round ponds, now dry, and half overgrown with rushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last bell of the steamer rang. Cytherea had forgotten herself, and
      what she was looking for. In a fever of distress lest Owen should be left
      behind, she gathered up in her hand the corners of her handkerchief,
      containing specimens of the shells, plants, and fossils which the locality
      produced, started off to the sands, and mingled with the knots of visitors
      there congregated from other interesting points around; from the inn, the
      cottages, and hired conveyances that had returned from short drives
      inland. They all went aboard by the primitive plan of a narrow plank on
      two wheels&mdash;the women being assisted by a rope. Cytherea lingered
      till the very last, reluctant to follow, and looking alternately at the
      boat and the valley behind. Her delay provoked a remark from Captain
      Jacobs, a thickset man of hybrid stains, resulting from the mixed effects
      of fire and water, peculiar to sailors where engines are the propelling
      power.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now then, missy, if you please. I am sorry to tell 'ee our time's up. Who
      are you looking for, miss?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My brother&mdash;he has walked a short distance inland; he must be here
      directly. Could you wait for him&mdash;just a minute?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Really, I am afraid not, m'm.' Cytherea looked at the stout, round-faced
      man, and at the vessel, with a light in her eyes so expressive of her own
      opinion being the same, on reflection, as his, and with such resignation,
      too, that, from an instinctive feeling of pride at being able to prove
      himself more humane than he was thought to be&mdash;works of
      supererogation are the only sacrifices that entice in this way&mdash;and
      that at a very small cost, he delayed the boat till some among the
      passengers began to murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There, never mind,' said Cytherea decisively. 'Go on without me&mdash;I
      shall wait for him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, 'tis a very awkward thing to leave you here all alone,' said the
      captain. 'I certainly advise you not to wait.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's gone across to the railway station, for certain,' said another
      passenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No&mdash;here he is!' Cytherea said, regarding, as she spoke, the half
      hidden figure of a man who was seen advancing at a headlong pace down the
      ravine which lay between the heath and the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He can't get here in less than five minutes,' a passenger said. 'People
      should know what they are about, and keep time. Really, if&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You see, sir,' said the captain, in an apologetic undertone, 'since 'tis
      her brother, and she's all alone, 'tis only nater to wait a minute, now
      he's in sight. Suppose, now, you were a young woman, as might be, and had
      a brother, like this one, and you stood of an evening upon this here wild
      lonely shore, like her, why you'd want us to wait, too, wouldn't you, sir?
      I think you would.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The person so hastily approaching had been lost to view during this remark
      by reason of a hollow in the ground, and the projecting cliff immediately
      at hand covered the path in its rise. His footsteps were now heard
      striking sharply upon the flinty road at a distance of about twenty or
      thirty yards, but still behind the escarpment. To save time, Cytherea
      prepared to ascend the plank.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let me give you my hand, miss,' said Captain Jacobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No&mdash;please don't touch me,' said she, ascending cautiously by
      sliding one foot forward two or three inches, bringing up the other behind
      it, and so on alternately&mdash;her lips compressed by concentration on
      the feat, her eyes glued to the plank, her hand to the rope, and her
      immediate thought to the fact of the distressing narrowness of her
      footing. Steps now shook the lower end of the board, and in an instant
      were up to her heels with a bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, Owen, I am so glad you are come!' she said without turning. 'Don't,
      don't shake the plank or touch me, whatever you do.... There, I am up.
      Where have you been so long?' she continued, in a lower tone, turning
      round to him as she reached the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raising her eyes from her feet, which, standing on the firm deck, demanded
      her attention no longer, she acquired perceptions of the new-comer in the
      following order: unknown trousers; unknown waistcoat; unknown face. The
      man was not her brother, but a total stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Off went the plank; the paddles started, stopped, backed, pattered in
      confusion, then revolved decisively, and the boat passed out into deep
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      One or two persons had said, 'How d'ye do, Mr. Springrove?' and looked at
      Cytherea, to see how she bore her disappointment. Her ears had but just
      caught the name of the head draughtsman, when she saw him advancing
      directly to address her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Graye, I believe?' he said, lifting his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said Cytherea, colouring, and trying not to look guilty of a
      surreptitious knowledge of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am Mr. Springrove. I passed Corvsgate Castle about an hour ago, and
      soon afterwards met your brother going that way. He had been deceived in
      the distance, and was about to turn without seeing the ruin, on account of
      a lameness that had come on in his leg or foot. I proposed that he should
      go on, since he had got so near; and afterwards, instead of walking back
      to the boat, get across to Anglebury Station&mdash;a shorter walk for him&mdash;where
      he could catch the late train, and go directly home. I could let you know
      what he had done, and allay any uneasiness.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is the lameness serious, do you know?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no; simply from over-walking himself. Still, it was just as well to
      ride home.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Relieved from her apprehensions on Owen's score, she was able slightly to
      examine the appearance of her informant&mdash;Edward Springrove&mdash;who
      now removed his hat for a while, to cool himself. He was rather above her
      brother's height. Although the upper part of his face and head was
      handsomely formed, and bounded by lines of sufficiently masculine
      regularity, his brows were somewhat too softly arched, and finely
      pencilled for one of his sex; without prejudice, however, to the belief
      which the sum total of his features inspired&mdash;that though they did
      not prove that the man who thought inside them would do much in the world,
      men who had done most of all had had no better ones. Across his forehead,
      otherwise perfectly smooth, ran one thin line, the healthy freshness of
      his remaining features expressing that it had come there prematurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though some years short of the age at which the clear spirit bids good-bye
      to the last infirmity of noble mind, and takes to house-hunting and
      investments, he had reached the period in a young man's life when episodic
      periods, with a hopeful birth and a disappointing death, have begun to
      accumulate, and to bear a fruit of generalities; his glance sometimes
      seeming to state, 'I have already thought out the issue of such conditions
      as these we are experiencing.' At other times he wore an abstracted look:
      'I seem to have lived through this moment before.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was carelessly dressed in dark grey, wearing a rolled-up black kerchief
      as a neck-cloth; the knot of which was disarranged, and stood obliquely&mdash;a
      deposit of white dust having lodged in the creases.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am sorry for your disappointment,' he continued, glancing into her
      face. Their eyes having met, became, as it were, mutually locked together,
      and the single instant only which good breeding allows as the length of
      such a look, became trebled: a clear penetrating ray of intelligence had
      shot from each into each, giving birth to one of those unaccountable
      sensations which carry home to the heart before the hand has been touched
      or the merest compliment passed, by something stronger than mathematical
      proof, the conviction, 'A tie has begun to unite us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Both faces also unconsciously stated that their owners had been much in
      each other's thoughts of late. Owen had talked to the young architect of
      his sister as freely as to Cytherea of the young architect.
    </p>
    <p>
      A conversation began, which was none the less interesting to the parties
      engaged because it consisted only of the most trivial and commonplace
      remarks. Then the band of harps and violins struck up a lively melody, and
      the deck was cleared for dancing; the sun dipping beneath the horizon
      during the proceeding, and the moon showing herself at their stern. The
      sea was so calm, that the soft hiss produced by the bursting of the
      innumerable bubbles of foam behind the paddles could be distinctly heard.
      The passengers who did not dance, including Cytherea and Springrove,
      lapsed into silence, leaning against the paddle-boxes, or standing aloof&mdash;noticing
      the trembling of the deck to the steps of the dance&mdash;watching the
      waves from the paddles as they slid thinly and easily under each other's
      edges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night had quite closed in by the time they reached Budmouth harbour,
      sparkling with its white, red, and green lights in opposition to the
      shimmering path of the moon's reflection on the other side, which reached
      away to the horizon till the flecked ripples reduced themselves to
      sparkles as fine as gold dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will walk to the station and find out the exact time the train
      arrives,' said Springrove, rather eagerly, when they had landed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thanked him much.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps we might walk together,' he suggested hesitatingly. She looked as
      if she did not quite know, and he settled the question by showing the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found, on arriving there, that on the first day of that month the
      particular train selected for Graye's return had ceased to stop at
      Anglebury station.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am very sorry I misled him,' said Springrove.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, I am not alarmed at all,' replied Cytherea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, it's sure to be all right&mdash;he will sleep there, and come by
      the first in the morning. But what will you do, alone?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am quite easy on that point; the landlady is very friendly. I must go
      indoors now. Good-night, Mr. Springrove.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let me go round to your door with you?' he pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, thank you; we live close by.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her as a waiter looks at the change he brings back. But she
      was inexorable.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't&mdash;forget me,' he murmured. She did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let me see you sometimes,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps you never will again&mdash;I am going away,' she replied in
      lingering tones; and turning into Cross Street, ran indoors and upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sudden withdrawal of what was superfluous at first, is often felt as
      an essential loss. It was felt now with regard to the maiden. More, too,
      after a meeting so pleasant and so enkindling, she had seemed to imply
      that they would never come together again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man softly followed her, stood opposite the house and watched
      her come into the upper room with the light. Presently his gaze was cut
      short by her approaching the window and pulling down the blind&mdash;Edward
      dwelling upon her vanishing figure with a hopeless sense of loss akin to
      that which Adam is said by logicians to have felt when he first saw the
      sun set, and thought, in his inexperience, that it would return no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited till her shadow had twice crossed the window, when, finding the
      charming outline was not to be expected again, he left the street, crossed
      the harbour-bridge, and entered his own solitary chamber on the other
      side, vaguely thinking as he went (for undefined reasons),

      III. THE EVENTS OF EIGHT DAYS
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1. FROM THE TWENTY-SECOND TO THE TWENTY-SEVENTH OF JULY
    </h3>
    <p>
      But things are not what they seem. A responsive love for Edward Springrove
      had made its appearance in Cytherea's bosom with all the fascinating
      attributes of a first experience, not succeeding to or displacing other
      emotions, as in older hearts, but taking up entirely new ground; as when
      gazing just after sunset at the pale blue sky we see a star come into
      existence where nothing was before.
    </p>
    <p>
      His parting words, 'Don't forget me,' she repeated to herself a hundred
      times, and though she thought their import was probably commonplace, she
      could not help toying with them,&mdash;looking at them from all points,
      and investing them with meanings of love and faithfulness,&mdash;ostensibly
      entertaining such meanings only as fables wherewith to pass the time, yet
      in her heart admitting, for detached instants, a possibility of their
      deeper truth. And thus, for hours after he had left her, her reason
      flirted with her fancy as a kitten will sport with a dove, pleasantly and
      smoothly through easy attitudes, but disclosing its cruel and unyielding
      nature at crises.
    </p>
    <p>
      To turn now to the more material media through which this story moves, it
      so happened that the very next morning brought round a circumstance which,
      slight in itself, took up a relevant and important position between the
      past and the future of the persons herein concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      At breakfast time, just as Cytherea had again seen the postman pass
      without bringing her an answer to the advertisement, as she had fully
      expected he would do, Owen entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' he said, kissing her, 'you have not been alarmed, of course.
      Springrove told you what I had done, and you found there was no train?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, it was all clear. But what is the lameness owing to?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know&mdash;nothing. It has quite gone off now... Cytherea, I hope
      you like Springrove. Springrove's a nice fellow, you know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. I think he is, except that&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It happened just to the purpose that I should meet him there, didn't it?
      And when I reached the station and learnt that I could not get on by train
      my foot seemed better. I started off to walk home, and went about five
      miles along a path beside the railway. It then struck me that I might not
      be fit for anything to-day if I walked and aggravated the bothering foot,
      so I looked for a place to sleep at. There was no available village or
      inn, and I eventually got the keeper of a gate-house, where a lane crossed
      the line, to take me in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They proceeded with their breakfast. Owen yawned.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You didn't get much sleep at the gate-house last night, I'm afraid,
      Owen,' said his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      'To tell the truth, I didn't. I was in such very close and narrow
      quarters. Those gate-houses are such small places, and the man had only
      his own bed to offer me. Ah, by-the-bye, Cythie, I have such an
      extraordinary thing to tell you in connection with this man!&mdash;by
      Jove, I had nearly forgotten it! But I'll go straight on. As I was saying,
      he had only his own bed to offer me, but I could not afford to be
      fastidious, and as he had a hearty manner, though a very queer one, I
      agreed to accept it, and he made a rough pallet for himself on the floor
      close beside me. Well, I could not sleep for my life, and I wished I had
      not stayed there, though I was so tired. For one thing, there were the
      luggage trains rattling by at my elbow the early part of the night. But
      worse than this, he talked continually in his sleep, and occasionally
      struck out with his limbs at something or another, knocking against the
      post of the bedstead and making it tremble. My condition was altogether so
      unsatisfactory that at last I awoke him, and asked him what he had been
      dreaming about for the previous hour, for I could get no sleep at all. He
      begged my pardon for disturbing me, but a name I had casually let fall
      that evening had led him to think of another stranger he had once had
      visit him, who had also accidentally mentioned the same name, and some
      very strange incidents connected with that meeting. The affair had
      occurred years and years ago; but what I had said had made him think and
      dream about it as if it were but yesterday. What was the word? I said.
      "Cytherea," he said. What was the story? I asked then. He then told me
      that when he was a young man in London he borrowed a few pounds to add to
      a few he had saved up, and opened a little inn at Hammersmith. One
      evening, after the inn had been open about a couple of months, every idler
      in the neighbourhood ran off to Westminster. The Houses of Parliament were
      on fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not a soul remained in his parlour besides himself, and he began picking
      up the pipes and glasses his customers had hastily relinquished. At length
      a young lady about seventeen or eighteen came in. She asked if a woman was
      there waiting for herself&mdash;Miss Jane Taylor. He said no; asked the
      young lady if she would wait, and showed her into the small inner room.
      There was a glass-pane in the partition dividing this room from the bar to
      enable the landlord to see if his visitors, who sat there, wanted
      anything. A curious awkwardness and melancholy about the behaviour of the
      girl who called, caused my informant to look frequently at her through the
      partition. She seemed weary of her life, and sat with her face buried in
      her hands, evidently quite out of her element in such a house. Then a
      woman much older came in and greeted Miss Taylor by name. The man
      distinctly heard the following words pass between them:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Why have you not brought him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"He is ill; he is not likely to live through the night."
    </p>
    <p>
      'At this announcement from the elderly woman, the young lady fell to the
      floor in a swoon, apparently overcome by the news. The landlord ran in and
      lifted her up. Well, do what they would they could not for a long time
      bring her back to consciousness, and began to be much alarmed. "Who is
      she?" the innkeeper said to the other woman. "I know her," the other said,
      with deep meaning in her tone. The elderly and young woman seemed allied,
      and yet strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She now showed signs of life, and it struck him (he was plainly of an
      inquisitive turn), that in her half-bewildered state he might get some
      information from her. He stooped over her, put his mouth to her ear, and
      said sharply, "What's your name?" "To catch a woman napping is difficult,
      even when she's half dead; but I did it," says the gatekeeper. When he
      asked her her name, she said immediately&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Cytherea"&mdash;and stopped suddenly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My own name!' said Cytherea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes&mdash;your name. Well, the gateman thought at the time it might be
      equally with Jane a name she had invented for the occasion, that they
      might not trace her; but I think it was truth unconsciously uttered, for
      she added directly afterwards: "O, what have I said!" and was quite
      overcome again&mdash;this time with fright. Her vexation that the woman
      now doubted the genuineness of her other name was very much greater than
      that the innkeeper did, and it is evident that to blind the woman was her
      main object. He also learnt from words the elderly woman casually dropped,
      that meetings of the same kind had been held before, and that the
      falseness of the soi-disant Miss Jane Taylor's name had never been
      suspected by this dependent or confederate till then.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She recovered, rested there for an hour, and first sending off her
      companion peremptorily (which was another odd thing), she left the house,
      offering the landlord all the money she had to say nothing about the
      circumstance. He has never seen her since, according to his own account. I
      said to him again and again, "Did you find any more particulars
      afterwards?" "Not a syllable," he said. O, he should never hear any more
      of that! too many years had passed since it happened. "At any rate, you
      found out her surname?" I said. "Well, well, that's my secret," he went
      on. "Perhaps I should never have been in this part of the world if it
      hadn't been for that. I failed as a publican, you know." I imagine the
      situation of gateman was given him and his debts paid off as a bribe to
      silence; but I can't say. "Ah, yes!" he said, with a long breath. "I have
      never heard that name mentioned since that time till to-night, and then
      there instantly rose to my eyes the vision of that young lady lying in a
      fainting fit." He then stopped talking and fell asleep. Telling the story
      must have relieved him as it did the Ancient Mariner, for he did not move
      a muscle or make another sound for the remainder of the night. Now isn't
      that an odd story?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is indeed,' Cytherea murmured. 'Very, very strange.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why should she have said your most uncommon name?' continued Owen. 'The
      man was evidently truthful, for there was not motive sufficient for his
      invention of such a tale, and he could not have done it either.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea looked long at her brother. 'Don't you recognize anything else in
      connection with the story?' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What?' he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you remember what poor papa once let drop&mdash;that Cytherea was the
      name of his first sweetheart in Bloomsbury, who so mysteriously renounced
      him? A sort of intuition tells me that this was the same woman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no&mdash;not likely,' said her brother sceptically.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How not likely, Owen? There's not another woman of the name in England.
      In what year used papa to say the event took place?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Eighteen hundred and thirty-five.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And when were the Houses of Parliament burnt?&mdash;stop, I can tell
      you.' She searched their little stock of books for a list of dates, and
      found one in an old school history.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The Houses of Parliament were burnt down in the evening of the sixteenth
      of October, eighteen hundred and thirty-four.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nearly a year and a quarter before she met father,' remarked Owen.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were silent. 'If papa had been alive, what a wonderful absorbing
      interest this story would have had for him,' said Cytherea by-and-by. 'And
      how strangely knowledge comes to us. We might have searched for a clue to
      her secret half the world over, and never found one. If we had really had
      any motive for trying to discover more of the sad history than papa told
      us, we should have gone to Bloomsbury; but not caring to do so, we go two
      hundred miles in the opposite direction, and there find information
      waiting to be told us. What could have been the secret, Owen?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Heaven knows. But our having heard a little more of her in this way (if
      she is the same woman) is a mere coincidence after all&mdash;a family
      story to tell our friends if we ever have any. But we shall never know any
      more of the episode now&mdash;trust our fates for that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea sat silently thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There was no answer this morning to your advertisement, Cytherea?' he
      continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      'None.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I could see that by your looks when I came in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Fancy not getting a single one,' she said sadly. 'Surely there must be
      people somewhere who want governesses?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; but those who want them, and can afford to have them, get them
      mostly by friends' recommendations; whilst those who want them, and can't
      afford to have them, make use of their poor relations.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What shall I do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind it. Go on living with me. Don't let the difficulty trouble
      your mind so; you think about it all day. I can keep you, Cythie, in a
      plain way of living. Twenty-five shillings a week do not amount to much
      truly; but then many mechanics have no more, and we live quite as
      sparingly as journeymen mechanics... It is a meagre narrow life we are
      drifting into,' he added gloomily, 'but it is a degree more tolerable than
      the worrying sensation of all the world being ashamed of you, which we
      experienced at Hocbridge.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I couldn't go back there again,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nor I. O, I don't regret our course for a moment. We did quite right in
      dropping out of the world.' The sneering tones of the remark were almost
      too laboured to be real. 'Besides,' he continued, 'something better for me
      is sure to turn up soon. I wish my engagement here was a permanent one
      instead of for only two months. It may, certainly, be for a longer time,
      but all is uncertain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wish I could get something to do; and I must too,' she said firmly.
      'Suppose, as is very probable, you are not wanted after the beginning of
      October&mdash;the time Mr. Gradfield mentioned&mdash;what should we do if
      I were dependent on you only throughout the winter?'
    </p>
    <p>
      They pondered on numerous schemes by which a young lady might be supposed
      to earn a decent livelihood&mdash;more or less convenient and feasible in
      imagination, but relinquished them all until advertising had been once
      more tried, this time taking lower ground. Cytherea was vexed at her
      temerity in having represented to the world that so inexperienced a being
      as herself was a qualified governess; and had a fancy that this
      presumption of hers might be one reason why no ladies applied. The new and
      humbler attempt appeared in the following form:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  'NURSERY GOVERNESS OR USEFUL COMPANION. A young person wishes to
  hear of a situation in either of the above capacities. Salary very
  moderate. She is a good needle-woman&mdash;Address G., 3 Cross Street,
  Budmouth.'
</pre>
    <p>
      In the evening they went to post the letter, and then walked up and down
      the Parade for a while. Soon they met Springrove, said a few words to him,
      and passed on. Owen noticed that his sister's face had become crimson.
      Rather oddly they met Springrove again in a few minutes. This time the
      three walked a little way together, Edward ostensibly talking to Owen,
      though with a single thought to the reception of his words by the maiden
      at the farther side, upon whom his gaze was mostly resting, and who was
      attentively listening&mdash;looking fixedly upon the pavement the while.
      It has been said that men love with their eyes; women with their ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Owen and himself were little more than acquaintances as yet, and as
      Springrove was wanting in the assurance of many men of his age, it now
      became necessary to wish his friends good-evening, or to find a reason for
      continuing near Cytherea by saying some nice new thing. He thought of a
      new thing; he proposed a pull across the bay. This was assented to. They
      went to the pier; stepped into one of the gaily painted boats moored
      alongside and sheered off. Cytherea sat in the stern steering.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rowed that evening; the next came, and with it the necessity of
      rowing again. Then the next, and the next, Cytherea always sitting in the
      stern with the tiller ropes in her hand. The curves of her figure welded
      with those of the fragile boat in perfect continuation, as she girlishly
      yielded herself to its heaving and sinking, seeming to form with it an
      organic whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Owen was inclined to test his skill in paddling a canoe. Edward did
      not like canoes, and the issue was, that, having seen Owen on board,
      Springrove proposed to pull off after him with a pair of sculls; but not
      considering himself sufficiently accomplished to do finished rowing before
      a parade full of promenaders when there was a little swell on, and with
      the rudder unshipped in addition, he begged that Cytherea might come with
      him and steer as before. She stepped in, and they floated along in the
      wake of her brother. Thus passed the fifth evening on the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sympathetic pair were thrown into still closer companionship, and
      much more exclusive connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. JULY THE TWENTY-NINTH
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a sad time for Cytherea&mdash;the last day of Springrove's
      management at Gradfield's, and the last evening before his return from
      Budmouth to his father's house, previous to his departure for London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Graye had been requested by the architect to survey a plot of land nearly
      twenty miles off, which, with the journey to and fro, would occupy him the
      whole day, and prevent his returning till late in the evening. Cytherea
      made a companion of her landlady to the extent of sharing meals and
      sitting with her during the morning of her brother's absence. Mid-day
      found her restless and miserable under this arrangement. All the afternoon
      she sat alone, looking out of the window for she scarcely knew whom, and
      hoping she scarcely knew what. Half-past five o'clock came&mdash;the end
      of Springrove's official day. Two minutes later Springrove walked by.
    </p>
    <p>
      She endured her solitude for another half-hour, and then could endure no
      longer. She had hoped&mdash;while affecting to fear&mdash;that Edward
      would have found some reason or other for calling, but it seemed that he
      had not. Hastily dressing herself she went out, when the farce of an
      accidental meeting was repeated. Edward came upon her in the street at the
      first turning, and, like the Great Duke Ferdinand in 'The Statue and the
      Bust'&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   'He looked at her as a lover can;
   She looked at him as one who awakes&mdash;
   The past was a sleep, and her life began.'
</pre>
    <p>
      'Shall we have a boat?' he said impulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      How blissful it all is at first. Perhaps, indeed, the only bliss in the
      course of love which can truly be called Eden-like is that which prevails
      immediately after doubt has ended and before reflection has set in&mdash;at
      the dawn of the emotion, when it is not recognized by name, and before the
      consideration of what this love is, has given birth to the consideration
      of what difficulties it tends to create; when on the man's part, the
      mistress appears to the mind's eye in picturesque, hazy, and fresh morning
      lights, and soft morning shadows; when, as yet, she is known only as the
      wearer of one dress, which shares her own personality; as the stander in
      one special position, the giver of one bright particular glance, and the
      speaker of one tender sentence; when, on her part, she is timidly careful
      over what she says and does, lest she should be misconstrued or
      under-rated to the breadth of a shadow of a hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shall we have a boat?' he said again, more softly, seeing that to his
      first question she had not answered, but looked uncertainly at the ground,
      then almost, but not quite, in his face, blushed a series of minute
      blushes, left off in the midst of them, and showed the usual signs of
      perplexity in a matter of the emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen had always been with her before, but there was now a force of habit
      in the proceeding, and with Arcadian innocence she assumed that a row on
      the water was, under any circumstances, a natural thing. Without another
      word being spoken on either side, they went down the steps. He carefully
      handed her in, took his seat, slid noiselessly off the sand, and away from
      the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      They thus sat facing each other in the graceful yellow cockle-shell, and
      his eyes frequently found a resting-place in the depths of hers. The boat
      was so small that at each return of the sculls, when his hands came
      forward to begin the pull, they approached so near to her that her vivid
      imagination began to thrill her with a fancy that he was going to clasp
      his arms round her. The sensation grew so strong that she could not run
      the risk of again meeting his eyes at those critical moments, and turned
      aside to inspect the distant horizon; then she grew weary of looking
      sideways, and was driven to return to her natural position again. At this
      instant he again leant forward to begin, and met her glance by an ardent
      fixed gaze. An involuntary impulse of girlish embarrassment caused her to
      give a vehement pull at the tiller-rope, which brought the boat's head
      round till they stood directly for shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes, which had dwelt upon her form during the whole time of her look
      askance, now left her; he perceived the direction in which they were
      going.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, you have completely turned the boat, Miss Graye?' he said, looking
      over his shoulder. 'Look at our track on the water&mdash;a great
      semicircle, preceded by a series of zigzags as far as we can see.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked attentively. 'Is it my fault or yours?' she inquired. 'Mine, I
      suppose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't help saying that it is yours.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She dropped the ropes decisively, feeling the slightest twinge of vexation
      at the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why do you let go?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do it so badly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no; you turned about for shore in a masterly way. Do you wish to
      return?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, if you please.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course, then, I will at once.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I fear what the people will think of us&mdash;going in such absurd
      directions, and all through my wretched steering.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind what the people think.' A pause. 'You surely are not so weak
      as to mind what the people think on such a matter as that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Those words might almost be called too firm and hard to be given by him to
      her; but never mind. For almost the first time in her life she felt the
      charming sensation, although on such an insignificant subject, of being
      compelled into an opinion by a man she loved. Owen, though less yielding
      physically, and more practical, would not have had the intellectual
      independence to answer a woman thus. She replied quietly and honestly&mdash;as
      honestly as when she had stated the contrary fact a minute earlier&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't mind.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll unship the tiller that you may have nothing to do going back but to
      hold your parasol,' he continued, and arose to perform the operation,
      necessarily leaning closely against her, to guard against the risk of
      capsizing the boat as he reached his hands astern. His warm breath touched
      and crept round her face like a caress; but he was apparently only
      concerned with his task. She looked guilty of something when he seated
      himself. He read in her face what that something was&mdash;she had
      experienced a pleasure from his touch. But he flung a practical glance
      over his shoulder, seized the oars, and they sped in a straight line
      towards the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea saw that he noted in her face what had passed in her heart, and
      that noting it, he continued as decided as before. She was inwardly
      distressed. She had not meant him to translate her words about returning
      home so literally at the first; she had not intended him to learn her
      secret; but more than all she was not able to endure the perception of his
      learning it and continuing unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing but misery to come now. They would step ashore; he would
      say good-night, go to London to-morrow, and the miserable She would lose
      him for ever. She did not quite suppose what was the fact, that a parallel
      thought was simultaneously passing through his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now within ten yards, now within five; he was only now waiting
      for a 'smooth' to bring the boat in. Sweet, sweet Love must not be slain
      thus, was the fair maid's reasoning. She was equal to the occasion&mdash;ladies
      are&mdash;and delivered the god&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you want very much to land, Mr. Springrove?' she said, letting her
      young violet eyes pine at him a very, very little.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I? Not at all,' said he, looking an astonishment at her inquiry which a
      slight twinkle of his eye half belied. 'But you do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think that now we have come out, and it is such a pleasant evening,'
      she said gently and sweetly, 'I should like a little longer row if you
      don't mind? I'll try to steer better than before if it makes it easier for
      you. I'll try very hard.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the turn of his face to tell a tale now. He looked, 'We understand
      each other&mdash;ah, we do, darling!' turned the boat, and pulled back
      into the Bay once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now steer wherever you will,' he said, in a low voice. 'Never mind the
      directness of the course&mdash;wherever you will.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shall it be Creston Shore?' she said, pointing to a stretch of beach
      northward from Budmouth Esplanade.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Creston Shore certainly,' he responded, grasping the sculls. She took the
      strings daintily, and they wound away to the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time nothing was audible in the boat but the regular dip of the
      oars, and their movement in the rowlocks. Springrove at length spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I must go away to-morrow,' he said tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' she replied faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'To endeavour to advance a little in my profession in London.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' she said again, with the same preoccupied softness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I shan't advance.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why not? Architecture is a bewitching profession. They say that an
      architect's work is another man's play.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. But worldly advantage from an art doesn't depend upon mastering it.
      I used to think it did; but it doesn't. Those who get rich need have no
      skill at all as artists.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What need they have?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A certain kind of energy which men with any fondness for art possess very
      seldom indeed&mdash;an earnestness in making acquaintances, and a love for
      using them. They give their whole attention to the art of dining out,
      after mastering a few rudimentary facts to serve up in conversation. Now
      after saying that, do I seem a man likely to make a name?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You seem a man likely to make a mistake.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'To give too much room to the latent feeling which is rather common in
      these days among the unappreciated, that because some remarkably
      successful men are fools, all remarkably unsuccessful men are geniuses.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pretty subtle for a young lady,' he said slowly. 'From that remark I
      should fancy you had bought experience.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed over the idea. 'Do try to succeed,' she said, with wistful
      thoughtfulness, leaving her eyes on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Springrove flushed a little at the earnestness of her words, and mused.
      'Then, like Cato the Censor, I shall do what I despise, to be in the
      fashion,' he said at last... 'Well, when I found all this out that I was
      speaking of, what ever do you think I did? From having already loved verse
      passionately, I went on to read it continually; then I went rhyming
      myself. If anything on earth ruins a man for useful occupation, and for
      content with reasonable success in a profession or trade, it is the habit
      of writing verses on emotional subjects, which had much better be left to
      die from want of nourishment.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you write poems now?' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'None. Poetical days are getting past with me, according to the usual
      rule. Writing rhymes is a stage people of my sort pass through, as they
      pass through the stage of shaving for a beard, or thinking they are
      ill-used, or saying there's nothing in the world worth living for.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then the difference between a common man and a recognized poet is, that
      one has been deluded, and cured of his delusion, and the other continues
      deluded all his days.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, there's just enough truth in what you say, to make the remark
      unbearable. However, it doesn't matter to me now that I "meditate the
      thankless Muse" no longer, but....' He paused, as if endeavouring to think
      what better thing he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea's mind ran on to the succeeding lines of the poem, and their
      startling harmony with the present situation suggested the fancy that he
      was 'sporting' with her, and brought an awkward contemplativeness to her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Springrove guessed her thoughts, and in answer to them simply said 'Yes.'
      Then they were silent again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If I had known an Amaryllis was coming here, I should not have made
      arrangements for leaving,' he resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such levity, superimposed on the notion of 'sport', was intolerable to
      Cytherea; for a woman seems never to see any but the serious side of her
      attachment, though the most devoted lover has all the time a vague and dim
      perception that he is losing his old dignity and frittering away his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But will you not try again to get on in your profession? Try once more;
      do try once more,' she murmured. 'I am going to try again. I have
      advertised for something to do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course I will,' he said, with an eager gesture and smile. 'But we must
      remember that the fame of Christopher Wren himself depended upon the
      accident of a fire in Pudding Lane. My successes seem to come very slowly.
      I often think, that before I am ready to live, it will be time for me to
      die. However, I am trying&mdash;not for fame now, but for an easy life of
      reasonable comfort.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a melancholy truth for the middle classes, that in proportion as
      they develop, by the study of poetry and art, their capacity for conjugal
      love of the highest and purest kind, they limit the possibility of their
      being able to exercise it&mdash;the very act putting out of their power
      the attainment of means sufficient for marriage. The man who works up a
      good income has had no time to learn love to its solemn extreme; the man
      who has learnt that has had no time to get rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And if you should fail&mdash;utterly fail to get that reasonable wealth,'
      she said earnestly, 'don't be perturbed. The truly great stand upon no
      middle ledge; they are either famous or unknown.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Unknown,' he said, 'if their ideas have been allowed to flow with a
      sympathetic breadth. Famous only if they have been convergent and
      exclusive.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; and I am afraid from that, that my remark was but discouragement,
      wearing the dress of comfort. Perhaps I was not quite right in&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It depends entirely upon what is meant by being truly great. But the long
      and the short of the matter is, that men must stick to a thing if they
      want to succeed in it&mdash;not giving way to over-much admiration for the
      flowers they see growing in other people's borders; which I am afraid has
      been my case.' He looked into the far distance and paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adherence to a course with persistence sufficient to ensure success is
      possible to widely appreciative minds only when there is also found in
      them a power&mdash;commonplace in its nature, but rare in such combination&mdash;the
      power of assuming to conviction that in the outlying paths which appear so
      much more brilliant than their own, there are bitternesses equally great&mdash;unperceived
      simply on account of their remoteness.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were opposite Ringsworth Shore. The cliffs here were formed of strata
      completely contrasting with those of the further side of the Bay, whilst
      in and beneath the water hard boulders had taken the place of sand and
      shingle, between which, however, the sea glided noiselessly, without
      breaking the crest of a single wave, so strikingly calm was the air. The
      breeze had entirely died away, leaving the water of that rare glassy
      smoothness which is unmarked even by the small dimples of the least aerial
      movement. Purples and blues of divers shades were reflected from this
      mirror accordingly as each undulation sloped east or west. They could see
      the rocky bottom some twenty feet beneath them, luxuriant with weeds of
      various growths, and dotted with pulpy creatures reflecting a silvery and
      spangled radiance upwards to their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length she looked at him to learn the effect of her words of
      encouragement. He had let the oars drift alongside, and the boat had come
      to a standstill. Everything on earth seemed taking a contemplative rest,
      as if waiting to hear the avowal of something from his lips. At that
      instant he appeared to break a resolution hitherto zealously kept. Leaving
      his seat amidships he came and gently edged himself down beside her upon
      the narrow seat at the stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      She breathed more quickly and warmly: he took her right hand in his own
      right: it was not withdrawn. He put his left hand behind her neck till it
      came round upon her left cheek: it was not thrust away. Lightly pressing
      her, he brought her face and mouth towards his own; when, at this the very
      brink, some unaccountable thought or spell within him suddenly made him
      halt&mdash;even now, and as it seemed as much to himself as to her, he
      timidly whispered 'May I?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her endeavour was to say No, so denuded of its flesh and sinews that its
      nature would hardly be recognized, or in other words a No from so near the
      affirmative frontier as to be affected with the Yes accent. It was thus a
      whispered No, drawn out to nearly a quarter of a minute's length, the O
      making itself audible as a sound like the spring coo of a pigeon on
      unusually friendly terms with its mate. Though conscious of her success in
      producing the kind of word she had wished to produce, she at the same time
      trembled in suspense as to how it would be taken. But the time available
      for doubt was so short as to admit of scarcely more than half a pulsation:
      pressing closer he kissed her. Then he kissed her again with a longer
      kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the supremely happy moment of their experience. The 'bloom' and the
      'purple light' were strong on the lineaments of both. Their hearts could
      hardly believe the evidence of their lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I love you, and you love me, Cytherea!' he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not deny it; and all seemed well. The gentle sounds around them
      from the hills, the plains, the distant town, the adjacent shore, the
      water heaving at their side, the kiss, and the long kiss, were all 'many a
      voice of one delight,' and in unison with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his mind flew back to the same unpleasant thought which had been
      connected with the resolution he had broken a minute or two earlier. 'I
      could be a slave at my profession to win you, Cytherea; I would work at
      the meanest, honest trade to be near you&mdash;much less claim you as
      mine; I would&mdash;anything. But I have not told you all; it is not this;
      you don't know what there is yet to tell. Could you forgive as you can
      love?' She was alarmed to see that he had become pale with the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No&mdash;do not speak,' he said. 'I have kept something from you, which
      has now become the cause of a great uneasiness. I had no right&mdash;to
      love you; but I did it. Something forbade&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What?' she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Something forbade me&mdash;till the kiss&mdash;yes, till the kiss came;
      and now nothing shall forbid it! We'll hope in spite of all... I must,
      however, speak of this love of ours to your brother. Dearest, you had
      better go indoors whilst I meet him at the station, and explain
      everything.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea's short-lived bliss was dead and gone. O, if she had known of
      this sequel would she have allowed him to break down the barrier of mere
      acquaintanceship&mdash;never, never!
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will you not explain to me?' she faintly urged. Doubt&mdash;indefinite,
      carking doubt had taken possession of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not now. You alarm yourself unnecessarily,' he said tenderly. 'My only
      reason for keeping silence is that with my present knowledge I may tell an
      untrue story. It may be that there is nothing to tell. I am to blame for
      haste in alluding to any such thing. Forgive me, sweet&mdash;forgive me.'
      Her heart was ready to burst, and she could not answer him. He returned to
      his place and took to the oars.
    </p>
    <p>
      They again made for the distant Esplanade, now, with its line of houses,
      lying like a dark grey band against the light western sky. The sun had
      set, and a star or two began to peep out. They drew nearer their
      destination, Edward as he pulled tracing listlessly with his eyes the red
      stripes upon her scarf, which grew to appear as black ones in the
      increasing dusk of evening. She surveyed the long line of lamps on the
      sea-wall of the town, now looking small and yellow, and seeming to send
      long tap-roots of fire quivering down deep into the sea. By-and-by they
      reached the landing-steps. He took her hand as before, and found it as
      cold as the water about them. It was not relinquished till he reached her
      door. His assurance had not removed the constraint of her manner: he saw
      that she blamed him mutely and with her eyes, like a captured sparrow.
      Left alone, he went and seated himself in a chair on the Esplanade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither could she go indoors to her solitary room, feeling as she did in
      such a state of desperate heaviness. When Springrove was out of sight she
      turned back, and arrived at the corner just in time to see him sit down.
      Then she glided pensively along the pavement behind him, forgetting
      herself to marble like Melancholy herself as she mused in his
      neighbourhood unseen. She heard, without heeding, the notes of pianos and
      singing voices from the fashionable houses at her back, from the open
      windows of which the lamp-light streamed to join that of the orange-hued
      full moon, newly risen over the Bay in front. Then Edward began to pace up
      and down, and Cytherea, fearing that he would notice her, hastened
      homeward, flinging him a last look as she passed out of sight. No promise
      from him to write: no request that she herself would do so&mdash;nothing
      but an indefinite expression of hope in the face of some fear unknown to
      her. Alas, alas!
    </p>
    <p>
      When Owen returned he found she was not in the small sitting-room, and
      creeping upstairs into her bedroom with a light, he discovered her there
      lying asleep upon the coverlet of the bed, still with her hat and jacket
      on. She had flung herself down on entering, and succumbed to the unwonted
      oppressiveness that ever attends full-blown love. The wet traces of tears
      were yet visible upon her long drooping lashes.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'Love is a sowre delight, and sugred griefe,
     A living death, and ever-dying life.'
</pre>
    <p>
      'Cytherea,' he whispered, kissing her. She awoke with a start, and vented
      an exclamation before recovering her judgment. 'He's gone!' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He has told me all,' said Graye soothingly. 'He is going off early
      to-morrow morning. 'Twas a shame of him to win you away from me, and cruel
      of you to keep the growth of this attachment a secret.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We couldn't help it,' she said, and then jumping up&mdash;'Owen, has he
      told you <i>all</i>?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'All of your love from beginning to end,' he said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward then had not told more&mdash;as he ought to have done: yet she
      could not convict him. But she would struggle against his fetters. She
      tingled to the very soles of her feet at the very possibility that he
      might be deluding her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Owen,' she continued, with dignity, 'what is he to me? Nothing. I must
      dismiss such weakness as this&mdash;believe me, I will. Something far more
      pressing must drive it away. I have been looking my position steadily in
      the face, and I must get a living somehow. I mean to advertise once more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Advertising is no use.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'This one will be.' He looked surprised at the sanguine tone of her
      answer, till she took a piece of paper from the table and showed it him.
      'See what I am going to do,' she said sadly, almost bitterly. This was her
      third effort:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  'LADY'S-MAID. Inexperienced. Age eighteen.&mdash;G., 3 Cross Street,
  Budmouth.'
</pre>
    <p>
      Owen&mdash;Owen the respectable&mdash;looked blank astonishment. He
      repeated in a nameless, varying tone, the two words&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lady's-maid!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; lady's-maid. 'Tis an honest profession,' said Cytherea bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But <i>you</i>, Cytherea?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I&mdash;who am I?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You will never be a lady's-maid&mdash;never, I am quite sure.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall try to be, at any rate.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Such a disgrace&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nonsense! I maintain that it is no disgrace!' she said, rather warmly.
      'You know very well&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, since you will, you must,' he interrupted. 'Why do you put
      "inexperienced?"'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because I am.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind that&mdash;scratch out "inexperienced." We are poor, Cytherea,
      aren't we?' he murmured, after a silence, 'and it seems that the two
      months will close my engagement here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We can put up with being poor,' she said, 'if they only give us work to
      do.... Yes, we desire as a blessing what was given us as a curse, and even
      that is denied. However, be cheerful, Owen, and never mind!'
    </p>
    <p>
      In justice to desponding men, it is as well to remember that the brighter
      endurance of women at these epochs&mdash;invaluable, sweet, angelic, as it
      is&mdash;owes more of its origin to a narrower vision that shuts out many
      of the leaden-eyed despairs in the van, than to a hopefulness intense
      enough to quell them.

      IV. THE EVENTS OF ONE DAY
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1. AUGUST THE FOURTH. TILL FOUR O'CLOCK
    </h3>
    <p>
      The early part of the next week brought an answer to Cytherea's last note
      of hope in the way of advertisement&mdash;not from a distance of hundreds
      of miles, London, Scotland, Ireland, the Continent&mdash;as Cytherea
      seemed to think it must, to be in keeping with the means adopted for
      obtaining it, but from a place in the neighbourhood of that in which she
      was living&mdash;a country mansion not twenty miles off. The reply ran
      thus:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                      KNAPWATER HOUSE,
                         August 3, 1864.
</pre>
    <p>
      'Miss Aldclyffe is in want of a young person as lady's-maid. The duties of
      the place are light. Miss Aldclyffe will be in Budmouth on Thursday, when
      (should G. still not have heard of a place) she would like to see her at
      the Belvedere Hotel, Esplanade, at four o'clock. No answer need be
      returned to this note.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A little earlier than the time named, Cytherea, clothed in a modest
      bonnet, and a black silk jacket, turned down to the hotel. Expectation,
      the fresh air from the water, the bright, far-extending outlook, raised
      the most delicate of pink colours to her cheeks, and restored to her tread
      a portion of that elasticity which her past troubles, and thoughts of
      Edward, had well-nigh taken away.
    </p>
    <p>
      She entered the vestibule, and went to the window of the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is Miss Aldclyffe here?' she said to a nicely-dressed barmaid in the
      foreground, who was talking to a landlady covered with chains, knobs, and
      clamps of gold, in the background.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, she isn't,' said the barmaid, not very civilly. Cytherea looked a
      shade too pretty for a plain dresser.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Aldclyffe is expected here,' the landlady said to a third person,
      out of sight, in the tone of one who had known for several days the fact
      newly discovered from Cytherea. 'Get ready her room&mdash;be quick.' From
      the alacrity with which the order was given and taken, it seemed to
      Cytherea that Miss Aldclyffe must be a woman of considerable importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are to have an interview with Miss Aldclyffe here?' the landlady
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The young person had better wait,' continued the landlady. With a
      money-taker's intuition she had rightly divined that Cytherea would bring
      no profit to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea was shown into a nondescript chamber, on the shady side of the
      building, which appeared to be either bedroom or dayroom, as occasion
      necessitated, and was one of a suite at the end of the first-floor
      corridor. The prevailing colour of the walls, curtains, carpet, and
      coverings of furniture, was more or less blue, to which the cold light
      coming from the north easterly sky, and falling on a wide roof of new
      slates&mdash;the only object the small window commanded&mdash;imparted a
      more striking paleness. But underneath the door, communicating with the
      next room of the suite, gleamed an infinitesimally small, yet very
      powerful, fraction of contrast&mdash;a very thin line of ruddy light,
      showing that the sun beamed strongly into this room adjoining. The line of
      radiance was the only cheering thing visible in the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      People give way to very infantine thoughts and actions when they wait; the
      battle-field of life is temporarily fenced off by a hard and fast line&mdash;the
      interview. Cytherea fixed her eyes idly upon the streak, and began
      picturing a wonderful paradise on the other side as the source of such a
      beam&mdash;reminding her of the well-known good deed in a naughty world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst she watched the particles of dust floating before the brilliant
      chink she heard a carriage and horses stop opposite the front of the
      house. Afterwards came the rustle of a lady's skirts down the corridor,
      and into the room communicating with the one Cytherea occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The golden line vanished in parts like the phosphorescent streak caused by
      the striking of a match; there was the fall of a light footstep on the
      floor just behind it: then a pause. Then the foot tapped impatiently, and
      'There's no one here!' was spoken imperiously by a lady's tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, madam; in the next room. I am going to fetch her,' said the
      attendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That will do&mdash;or you needn't go in; I will call her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea had risen, and she advanced to the middle door with the chink
      under it as the servant retired. She had just laid her hand on the knob,
      when it slipped round within her fingers, and the door was pulled open
      from the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. FOUR O'CLOCK
    </p>
    <p>
      The direct blaze of the afternoon sun, partly refracted through the
      crimson curtains of the window, and heightened by reflections from the
      crimson-flock paper which covered the walls, and a carpet on the floor of
      the same tint, shone with a burning glow round the form of a lady standing
      close to Cytherea's front with the door in her hand. The stranger appeared
      to the maiden's eyes&mdash;fresh from the blue gloom, and assisted by an
      imagination fresh from nature&mdash;like a tall black figure standing in
      the midst of fire. It was the figure of a finely-built woman, of spare
      though not angular proportions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea involuntarily shaded her eyes with her hand, retreated a step or
      two, and then she could for the first time see Miss Aldclyffe's face in
      addition to her outline, lit up by the secondary and softer light that was
      reflected from the varnished panels of the door. She was not a very young
      woman, but could boast of much beauty of the majestic autumnal phase.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O,' said the lady, 'come this way.' Cytherea followed her to the
      embrasure of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the women showed off themselves to advantage as they walked forward
      in the orange light; and each showed too in her face that she had been
      struck with her companion's appearance. The warm tint added to Cytherea's
      face a voluptuousness which youth and a simple life had not yet allowed to
      express itself there ordinarily; whilst in the elder lady's face it
      reduced the customary expression, which might have been called sternness,
      if not harshness, to grandeur, and warmed her decaying complexion with
      much of the youthful richness it plainly had once possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She appeared now no more than five-and-thirty, though she might easily
      have been ten or a dozen years older. She had clear steady eyes, a Roman
      nose in its purest form, and also the round prominent chin with which the
      Caesars are represented in ancient marbles; a mouth expressing a
      capability for and tendency to strong emotion, habitually controlled by
      pride. There was a severity about the lower outlines of the face which
      gave a masculine cast to this portion of her countenance. Womanly weakness
      was nowhere visible save in one part&mdash;the curve of her forehead and
      brows&mdash;there it was clear and emphatic. She wore a lace shawl over a
      brown silk dress, and a net bonnet set with a few blue cornflowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You inserted the advertisement for a situation as lady's-maid giving the
      address, G., Cross Street?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, madam. Graye.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. I have heard your name&mdash;Mrs. Morris, my housekeeper, mentioned
      you, and pointed out your advertisement.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This was puzzling intelligence, but there was not time enough to consider
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where did you live last?' continued Miss Aldclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have never been a servant before. I lived at home.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never been out? I thought too at sight of you that you were too
      girlish-looking to have done much. But why did you advertise with such
      assurance? It misleads people.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am very sorry: I put "inexperienced" at first, but my brother said it
      is absurd to trumpet your own weakness to the world, and would not let it
      remain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But your mother knew what was right, I suppose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have no mother, madam.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your father, then?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have no father.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' she said, more softly, 'your sisters, aunts, or cousins.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'They didn't think anything about it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You didn't ask them, I suppose.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You should have done so, then. Why didn't you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because I haven't any of them, either.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe showed her surprise. 'You deserve forgiveness then at any
      rate, child,' she said, in a sort of drily-kind tone. 'However, I am
      afraid you do not suit me, as I am looking for an elderly person. You see,
      I want an experienced maid who knows all the usual duties of the office.'
      She was going to add, 'Though I like your appearance,' but the words
      seemed offensive to apply to the ladylike girl before her, and she
      modified them to, 'though I like you much.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am sorry I misled you, madam,' said Cytherea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe stood in a reverie, without replying.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good afternoon,' continued Cytherea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good-bye, Miss Graye&mdash;I hope you will succeed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea turned away towards the door. The movement chanced to be one of
      her masterpieces. It was precise: it had as much beauty as was compatible
      with precision, and as little coquettishness as was compatible with
      beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she had in turning looked over her shoulder at the other lady with a
      faint accent of reproach in her face. Those who remember Greuze's 'Head of
      a Girl,' have an idea of Cytherea's look askance at the turning. It is not
      for a man to tell fishers of men how to set out their fascinations so as
      to bring about the highest possible average of takes within the year: but
      the action that tugs the hardest of all at an emotional beholder is this
      sweet method of turning which steals the bosom away and leaves the eyes
      behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Miss Aldclyffe herself was no tyro at wheeling. When Cytherea had
      closed the door upon her, she remained for some time in her motionless
      attitude, listening to the gradually dying sound of the maiden's
      retreating footsteps. She murmured to herself, 'It is almost worth while
      to be bored with instructing her in order to have a creature who could
      glide round my luxurious indolent body in that manner, and look at me in
      that way&mdash;I warrant how light her fingers are upon one's head and
      neck.... What a silly modest young thing she is, to go away so suddenly as
      that!' She rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ask the young lady who has just left me to step back again,' she said to
      the attendant. 'Quick! or she will be gone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea was now in the vestibule, thinking that if she had told her
      history, Miss Aldclyffe might perhaps have taken her into the household;
      yet her history she particularly wished to conceal from a stranger. When
      she was recalled she turned back without feeling much surprise. Something,
      she knew not what, told her she had not seen the last of Miss Aldclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You have somebody to refer me to, of course,' the lady said, when
      Cytherea had re-entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes: Mr. Thorn, a solicitor at Aldbrickham.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And are you a clever needlewoman?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am considered to be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I think that at any rate I will write to Mr. Thorn,' said Miss
      Aldclyffe, with a little smile. 'It is true, the whole proceeding is very
      irregular; but my present maid leaves next Monday, and neither of the five
      I have already seen seem to do for me.... Well, I will write to Mr. Thorn,
      and if his reply is satisfactory, you shall hear from me. It will be as
      well to set yourself in readiness to come on Monday.'
    </p>
    <p>
      When Cytherea had again been watched out of the room, Miss Aldclyffe asked
      for writing materials, that she might at once communicate with Mr. Thorn.
      She indecisively played with the pen. 'Suppose Mr. Thorn's reply to be in
      any way disheartening&mdash;and even if so from his own imperfect
      acquaintance with the young creature more than from circumstantial
      knowledge&mdash;I shall feel obliged to give her up. Then I shall regret
      that I did not give her one trial in spite of other people's prejudices.
      All her account of herself is reliable enough&mdash;yes, I can see that by
      her face. I like that face of hers.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe put down the pen and left the hotel without writing to Mr.
      Thorn.

    <h2>
      V. THE EVENTS OF ONE DAY
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1. AUGUST THE EIGHTH. MORNING AND AFTERNOON
    </h3>
    <p>
      At post-time on that following Monday morning, Cytherea watched so
      anxiously for the postman, that as the time which must bring him narrowed
      less and less her vivid expectation had only a degree less tangibility
      than his presence itself. In another second his form came into view. He
      brought two letters for Cytherea.
    </p>
    <p>
      One from Miss Aldclyffe, simply stating that she wished Cytherea to come
      on trial: that she would require her to be at Knapwater House by Monday
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other was from Edward Springrove. He told her that she was the bright
      spot of his life: that her existence was far dearer to him than his own:
      that he had never known what it was to love till he had met her. True, he
      had felt passing attachments to other faces from time to time; but they
      all had been weak inclinations towards those faces as they then appeared.
      He loved her past and future, as well as her present. He pictured her as a
      child: he loved her. He pictured her of sage years: he loved her. He
      pictured her in trouble; he loved her. Homely friendship entered into his
      love for her, without which all love was evanescent.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would make one depressing statement. Uncontrollable circumstances (a
      long history, with which it was impossible to acquaint her at present)
      operated to a certain extent as a drag upon his wishes. He had felt this
      more strongly at the time of their parting than he did now&mdash;and it
      was the cause of his abrupt behaviour, for which he begged her to forgive
      him. He saw now an honourable way of freeing himself, and the perception
      had prompted him to write. In the meantime might he indulge in the hope of
      possessing her on some bright future day, when by hard labour generated
      from her own encouraging words, he had placed himself in a position she
      would think worthy to be shared with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear little letter; she huddled it up. So much more important a
      love-letter seems to a girl than to a man. Springrove was unconsciously
      clever in his letters, and a man with a talent of that kind may write
      himself up to a hero in the mind of a young woman who loves him without
      knowing much about him. Springrove already stood a cubit higher in her
      imagination than he did in his shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the day she flitted about the room in an ecstasy of pleasure,
      packing the things and thinking of an answer which should be worthy of the
      tender tone of the question, her love bubbling from her involuntarily,
      like prophesyings from a prophet.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon Owen went with her to the railway-station, and put her in
      the train for Carriford Road, the station nearest to Knapwater House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-an-hour later she stepped out upon the platform, and found nobody
      there to receive her&mdash;though a pony-carriage was waiting outside. In
      two minutes she saw a melancholy man in cheerful livery running towards
      her from a public-house close adjoining, who proved to be the servant sent
      to fetch her. There are two ways of getting rid of sorrows: one by living
      them down, the other by drowning them. The coachman drowned his.
    </p>
    <p>
      He informed her that her luggage would be fetched by a spring-waggon in
      about half-an-hour; then helped her into the chaise and drove off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lover's letter, lying close against her neck, fortified her against
      the restless timidity she had previously felt concerning this new
      undertaking, and completely furnished her with the confident ease of mind
      which is required for the critical observation of surrounding objects. It
      was just that stage in the slow decline of the summer days, when the deep,
      dark, and vacuous hot-weather shadows are beginning to be replaced by blue
      ones that have a surface and substance to the eye. They trotted along the
      turnpike road for a distance of about a mile, which brought them just
      outside the village of Carriford, and then turned through large
      lodge-gates, on the heavy stone piers of which stood a pair of bitterns
      cast in bronze. They then entered the park and wound along a drive shaded
      by old and drooping lime-trees, not arranged in the form of an avenue, but
      standing irregularly, sometimes leaving the track completely exposed to
      the sky, at other times casting a shade over it, which almost approached
      gloom&mdash;the under surface of the lowest boughs hanging at a uniform
      level of six feet above the grass&mdash;the extreme height to which the
      nibbling mouths of the cattle could reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is that the house?' said Cytherea expectantly, catching sight of a grey
      gable between the trees, and losing it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No; that's the old manor-house&mdash;or rather all that's left of it. The
      Aldycliffes used to let it sometimes, but it was oftener empty. 'Tis now
      divided into three cottages. Respectable people didn't care to live
      there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why didn't they?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, 'tis so awkward and unhandy. You see so much of it has been pulled
      down, and the rooms that are left won't do very well for a small
      residence. 'Tis so dismal, too, and like most old houses stands too low
      down in the hollow to be healthy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do they tell any horrid stories about it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, not a single one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, that's a pity.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, that's what I say. 'Tis jest the house for a nice ghastly
      hair-on-end story, that would make the parish religious. Perhaps it will
      have one some day to make it complete; but there's not a word of the kind
      now. There, I wouldn't live there for all that. In fact, I couldn't. O no,
      I couldn't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why couldn't you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The sounds.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What are they?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'One is the waterfall, which stands so close by that you can hear that
      there waterfall in every room of the house, night or day, ill or well.
      'Tis enough to drive anybody mad: now hark.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped the horse. Above the slight common sounds in the air came the
      unvarying steady rush of falling water from some spot unseen on account of
      the thick foliage of the grove.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's something awful in the timing o' that sound, ain't there, miss?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'When you say there is, there really seems to be. You said there were two&mdash;what
      is the other horrid sound?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The pumping-engine. That's close by the Old House, and sends water up the
      hill and all over the Great House. We shall hear that directly.... There,
      now hark again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      From the same direction down the dell they could now hear the whistling
      creak of cranks, repeated at intervals of half-a-minute, with a sousing
      noise between each: a creak, a souse, then another creak, and so on
      continually.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now if anybody could make shift to live through the other sounds, these
      would finish him off, don't you think so, miss? That machine goes on night
      and day, summer and winter, and is hardly ever greased or visited. Ah, it
      tries the nerves at night, especially if you are not very well; though we
      don't often hear it at the Great House.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That sound is certainly very dismal. They might have the wheel greased.
      Does Miss Aldclyffe take any interest in these things?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, scarcely; you see her father doesn't attend to that sort of thing
      as he used to. The engine was once quite his hobby. But now he's getten
      old and very seldom goes there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How many are there in family?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Only her father and herself. He's a' old man of seventy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I had thought that Miss Aldclyffe was sole mistress of the property, and
      lived here alone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, m&mdash;' The coachman was continually checking himself thus, being
      about to style her miss involuntarily, and then recollecting that he was
      only speaking to the new lady's-maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She will soon be mistress, however, I am afraid,' he continued, as if
      speaking by a spirit of prophecy denied to ordinary humanity. 'The poor
      old gentleman has decayed very fast lately.' The man then drew a long
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why did you breathe sadly like that?' said Cytherea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah!... When he's dead peace will be all over with us old servants. I
      expect to see the old house turned inside out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She will marry, do you mean?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Marry&mdash;not she! I wish she would. No, in her soul she's as solitary
      as Robinson Crusoe, though she has acquaintances in plenty, if not
      relations. There's the rector, Mr. Raunham&mdash;he's a relation by
      marriage&mdash;yet she's quite distant towards him. And people say that if
      she keeps single there will be hardly a life between Mr. Raunham and the
      heirship of the estate. Dang it, she don't care. She's an extraordinary
      picture of womankind&mdash;very extraordinary.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In what way besides?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'll know soon enough, miss. She has had seven lady's-maids this last
      twelvemonth. I assure you 'tis one body's work to fetch 'em from the
      station and take 'em back again. The Lord must be a neglectful party at
      heart, or he'd never permit such overbearen goings on!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Does she dismiss them directly they come!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not at all&mdash;she never dismisses them&mdash;they go theirselves. Ye
      see 'tis like this. She's got a very quick temper; she flees in a passion
      with them for nothing at all; next mornen they come up and say they are
      going; she's sorry for it and wishes they'd stay, but she's as proud as a
      lucifer, and her pride won't let her say, "Stay," and away they go. 'Tis
      like this in fact. If you say to her about anybody, "Ah, poor thing!" she
      says, "Pooh! indeed!" If you say, "Pooh, indeed!" "Ah, poor thing!" she
      says directly. She hangs the chief baker, as mid be, and restores the
      chief butler, as mid be, though the devil but Pharaoh herself can see the
      difference between 'em.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea was silent. She feared she might be again a burden to her
      brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      'However, you stand a very good chance,' the man went on, 'for I think she
      likes you more than common. I have never known her send the pony-carriage
      to meet one before; 'tis always the trap, but this time she said, in a
      very particular ladylike tone, "Roobert, gaow with the pony-kerriage."...
      There, 'tis true, pony and carriage too are getten rather shabby now,' he
      added, looking round upon the vehicle as if to keep Cytherea's pride
      within reasonable limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis to be hoped you'll please in dressen her to-night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why to-night?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's a dinner-party of seventeen; 'tis her father's birthday, and
      she's very particular about her looks at such times. Now see; this is the
      house. Livelier up here, isn't it, miss?'
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now on rising ground, and had just emerged from a clump of
      trees. Still a little higher than where they stood was situated the
      mansion, called Knapwater House, the offices gradually losing themselves
      among the trees behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. EVENING
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was regularly and substantially built of clean grey freestone
      throughout, in that plainer fashion of Greek classicism which prevailed at
      the latter end of the last century, when the copyists called designers had
      grown weary of fantastic variations in the Roman orders. The main block
      approximated to a square on the ground plan, having a projection in the
      centre of each side, surmounted by a pediment. From each angle of the
      inferior side ran a line of buildings lower than the rest, turning inwards
      again at their further end, and forming within them a spacious open court,
      within which resounded an echo of astonishing clearness. These erections
      were in their turn backed by ivy-covered ice-houses, laundries, and
      stables, the whole mass of subsidiary buildings being half buried beneath
      close-set shrubs and trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was opening sufficient through the foliage on the right hand to
      enable her on nearer approach to form an idea of the arrangement of the
      remoter or lawn front also. The natural features and contour of this
      quarter of the site had evidently dictated the position of the house
      primarily, and were of the ordinary, and upon the whole, most satisfactory
      kind, namely, a broad, graceful slope running from the terrace beneath the
      walls to the margin of a placid lake lying below, upon the surface of
      which a dozen swans and a green punt floated at leisure. An irregular
      wooded island stood in the midst of the lake; beyond this and the further
      margin of the water were plantations and greensward of varied outlines,
      the trees heightening, by half veiling, the softness of the exquisite
      landscape stretching behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glimpses she had obtained of this portion were now checked by the
      angle of the building. In a minute or two they reached the side door, at
      which Cytherea alighted. She was welcomed by an elderly woman of lengthy
      smiles and general pleasantness, who announced herself to be Mrs. Morris,
      the housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. Graye, I believe?' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am not&mdash;O yes, yes, we are all mistresses,' said Cytherea,
      smiling, but forcedly. The title accorded her seemed disagreeably like the
      first slight scar of a brand, and she thought of Owen's prophecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Morris led her into a comfortable parlour called The Room. Here tea
      was made ready, and Cytherea sat down, looking, whenever occasion allowed,
      at Mrs. Morris with great interest and curiosity, to discover, if
      possible, something in her which should give a clue to the secret of her
      knowledge of herself, and the recommendation based upon it. But nothing
      was to be learnt, at any rate just then. Mrs. Morris was perpetually
      getting up, feeling in her pockets, going to cupboards, leaving the room
      two or three minutes, and trotting back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'll excuse me, Mrs. Graye,' she said, 'but 'tis the old gentleman's
      birthday, and they always have a lot of people to dinner on that day,
      though he's getting up in years now. However, none of them are sleepers&mdash;she
      generally keeps the house pretty clear of lodgers (being a lady with no
      intimate friends, though many acquaintances), which, though it gives us
      less to do, makes it all the duller for the younger maids in the house.'
      Mrs. Morris then proceeded to give in fragmentary speeches an outline of
      the constitution and government of the estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, are you sure you have quite done tea? Not a bit or drop more? Why,
      you've eaten nothing, I'm sure.... Well, now, it is rather inconvenient
      that the other maid is not here to show you the ways of the house a
      little, but she left last Saturday, and Miss Aldclyffe has been making
      shift with poor old clumsy me for a maid all yesterday and this morning.
      She is not come in yet. I expect she will ask for you, Mrs. Graye, the
      first thing.... I was going to say that if you have really done tea, I
      will take you upstairs, and show you through the wardrobes&mdash;Miss
      Aldclyffe's things are not laid out for to-night yet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She preceded Cytherea upstairs, pointed out her own room, and then took
      her into Miss Aldclyffe's dressing-room, on the first-floor; where, after
      explaining the whereabouts of various articles of apparel, the housekeeper
      left her, telling her that she had an hour yet upon her hands before
      dressing-time. Cytherea laid out upon the bed in the next room all that
      she had been told would be required that evening, and then went again to
      the little room which had been appropriated to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here she sat down by the open window, leant out upon the sill like another
      Blessed Damozel, and listlessly looked down upon the brilliant pattern of
      colours formed by the flower-beds on the lawn&mdash;now richly crowded
      with late summer blossom. But the vivacity of spirit which had hitherto
      enlivened her, was fast ebbing under the pressure of prosaic realities,
      and the warm scarlet of the geraniums, glowing most conspicuously, and
      mingling with the vivid cold red and green of the verbenas, the rich depth
      of the dahlia, and the ripe mellowness of the calceolaria, backed by the
      pale hue of a flock of meek sheep feeding in the open park, close to the
      other side of the fence, were, to a great extent, lost upon her eyes. She
      was thinking that nothing seemed worth while; that it was possible she
      might die in a workhouse; and what did it matter? The petty, vulgar
      details of servitude that she had just passed through, her dependence upon
      the whims of a strange woman, the necessity of quenching all individuality
      of character in herself, and relinquishing her own peculiar tastes to help
      on the wheel of this alien establishment, made her sick and sad, and she
      almost longed to pursue some free, out-of-doors employment, sleep under
      trees or a hut, and know no enemy but winter and cold weather, like
      shepherds and cowkeepers, and birds and animals&mdash;ay, like the sheep
      she saw there under her window. She looked sympathizingly at them for
      several minutes, imagining their enjoyment of the rich grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes&mdash;like those sheep,' she said aloud; and her face reddened with
      surprise at a discovery she made that very instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flock consisted of some ninety or a hundred young stock ewes: the
      surface of their fleece was as rounded and even as a cushion, and white as
      milk. Now she had just observed that on the left buttock of every one of
      them were marked in distinct red letters the initials 'E. S.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'E. S.' could bring to Cytherea's mind only one thought; but that
      immediately and for ever&mdash;the name of her lover, Edward Springrove.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, if it should be&mdash;!' She interrupted her words by a resolve. Miss
      Aldclyffe's carriage at the same moment made its appearance in the drive;
      but Miss Aldclyffe was not her object now. It was to ascertain to whom the
      sheep belonged, and to set her surmise at rest one way or the other. She
      flew downstairs to Mrs. Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whose sheep are those in the park, Mrs. Morris?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Farmer Springrove's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What Farmer Springrove is that?' she said quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, surely you know? Your friend, Farmer Springrove, the cider-maker,
      and who keeps the Three Tranters Inn; who recommended you to me when he
      came in to see me the other day?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea's mother-wit suddenly warned her in the midst of her excitement
      that it was necessary not to betray the secret of her love. 'O yes,' she
      said, 'of course.' Her thoughts had run as follows in that short interval:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Farmer Springrove is Edward's father, and his name is Edward too.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Edward knew I was going to advertise for a situation of some kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He watched the Times, and saw it, my address being attached.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He thought it would be excellent for me to be here that we might meet
      whenever he came home.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He told his father that I might be recommended as a lady's-maid; and he
      knew my brother and myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'His father told Mrs. Morris; Mrs. Morris told Miss Aldclyffe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole chain of incidents that drew her there was plain, and there was
      no such thing as chance in the matter. It was all Edward's doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of a bell was heard. Cytherea did not heed it, and still
      continued in her reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's Miss Aldclyffe's bell,' said Mrs. Morris.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose it is,' said the young woman placidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, it means that you must go up to her,' the matron continued, in a
      tone of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea felt a burning heat come over her, mingled with a sudden
      irritation at Mrs. Morris's hint. But the good sense which had recognized
      stern necessity prevailed over rebellious independence; the flush passed,
      and she said hastily&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes; of course, I must go to her when she pulls the bell&mdash;whether
      I want to or no.'
    </p>
    <p>
      However, in spite of this painful reminder of her new position in life,
      Cytherea left the apartment in a mood far different from the gloomy
      sadness of ten minutes previous. The place felt like home to her now; she
      did not mind the pettiness of her occupation, because Edward evidently did
      not mind it; and this was Edward's own spot. She found time on her way to
      Miss Aldclyffe's dressing-room to hurriedly glide out by a side door, and
      look for a moment at the unconscious sheep bearing the friendly initials.
      She went up to them to try to touch one of the flock, and felt vexed that
      they all stared sceptically at her kind advances, and then ran pell-mell
      down the hill. Then, fearing any one should discover her childish
      movements, she slipped indoors again, and ascended the staircase, catching
      glimpses, as she passed, of silver-buttoned footmen, who flashed about the
      passages like lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe's dressing-room was an apartment which, on a casual survey,
      conveyed an impression that it was available for almost any purpose save
      the adornment of the feminine person. In its hours of perfect order
      nothing pertaining to the toilet was visible; even the inevitable mirrors
      with their accessories were arranged in a roomy recess not noticeable from
      the door, lighted by a window of its own, called the dressing-window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The washing-stand figured as a vast oak chest, carved with grotesque
      Renaissance ornament. The dressing table was in appearance something
      between a high altar and a cabinet piano, the surface being richly worked
      in the same style of semi-classic decoration, but the extraordinary
      outline having been arrived at by an ingenious joiner and decorator from
      the neighbouring town, after months of painful toil in cutting and
      fitting, under Miss Aldclyffe's immediate eye; the materials being the
      remains of two or three old cabinets the lady had found in the
      lumber-room. About two-thirds of the floor was carpeted, the remaining
      portion being laid with parquetry of light and dark woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe was standing at the larger window, away from the
      dressing-niche. She bowed, and said pleasantly, 'I am glad you have come.
      We shall get on capitally, I dare say.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her bonnet was off. Cytherea did not think her so handsome as on the
      earlier day; the queenliness of her beauty was harder and less warm. But a
      worse discovery than this was that Miss Aldclyffe, with the usual
      obliviousness of rich people to their dependents' specialities, seemed to
      have quite forgotten Cytherea's inexperience, and mechanically delivered
      up her body to her handmaid without a thought of details, and with a mild
      yawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything went well at first. The dress was removed, stockings and black
      boots were taken off, and silk stockings and white shoes were put on. Miss
      Aldclyffe then retired to bathe her hands and face, and Cytherea drew
      breath. If she could get through this first evening, all would be right.
      She felt that it was unfortunate that such a crucial test for her powers
      as a birthday dinner should have been applied on the threshold of her
      arrival; but set to again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe was now arrayed in a white dressing-gown, and dropped
      languidly into an easy-chair, pushed up before the glass. The instincts of
      her sex and her own practice told Cytherea the next movement. She let Miss
      Aldclyffe's hair fall about her shoulders, and began to arrange it. It
      proved to be all real; a satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe was musingly looking on the floor, and the operation went
      on for some minutes in silence. At length her thoughts seemed to turn to
      the present, and she lifted her eyes to the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, what on earth are you doing with my head?' she exclaimed, with
      widely opened eyes. At the words she felt the back of Cytherea's little
      hand tremble against her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps you prefer it done the other fashion, madam?' said the maiden.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no; that's the fashion right enough, but you must make more show of
      my hair than that, or I shall have to buy some, which God forbid!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is how I do my own,' said Cytherea naively, and with a sweetness of
      tone that would have pleased the most acrimonious under favourable
      circumstances; but tyranny was in the ascendant with Miss Aldclyffe at
      this moment, and she was assured of palatable food for her vice by having
      felt the trembling of Cytherea's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yours, indeed! <i>Your</i> hair! Come, go on.' Considering that Cytherea
      possessed at least five times as much of that valuable auxiliary to
      woman's beauty as the lady before her, there was at the same time some
      excuse for Miss Aldclyffe's outburst. She remembered herself, however, and
      said more quietly, 'Now then, Graye&mdash;By-the-bye, what do they call
      you downstairs?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. Graye,' said the handmaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then tell them not to do any such absurd thing&mdash;not but that it is
      quite according to usage; but you are too young yet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This dialogue tided Cytherea safely onward through the hairdressing till
      the flowers and diamonds were to be placed upon the lady's brow. Cytherea
      began arranging them tastefully, and to the very best of her judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That won't do,' said Miss Aldclyffe harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I look too young&mdash;an old dressed doll.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will that, madam?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I look a fright&mdash;a perfect fright!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'This way, perhaps?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Heavens! Don't worry me so.' She shut her lips like a trap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having once worked herself up to the belief that her head-dress was to be
      a failure that evening, no cleverness of Cytherea's in arranging it could
      please her. She continued in a smouldering passion during the remainder of
      the performance, keeping her lips firmly closed, and the muscles of her
      body rigid. Finally, snatching up her gloves, and taking her handkerchief
      and fan in her hand, she silently sailed out of the room, without
      betraying the least consciousness of another woman's presence behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea's fears that at the undressing this suppressed anger would find a
      vent, kept her on thorns throughout the evening. She tried to read; she
      could not. She tried to sew; she could not. She tried to muse; she could
      not do that connectedly. 'If this is the beginning, what will the end be!'
      she said in a whisper, and felt many misgivings as to the policy of being
      overhasty in establishing an independence at the expense of congruity with
      a cherished past.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. MIDNIGHT
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock struck twelve. The Aldclyffe state dinner was over. The company
      had all gone, and Miss Aldclyffe's bell rang loudly and jerkingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea started to her feet at the sound, which broke in upon a fitful
      sleep that had overtaken her. She had been sitting drearily in her chair
      waiting minute after minute for the signal, her brain in that state of
      intentness which takes cognizance of the passage of Time as a real motion&mdash;motion
      without matter&mdash;the instants throbbing past in the company of a
      feverish pulse. She hastened to the room, to find the lady sitting before
      the dressing shrine, illuminated on both sides, and looking so queenly in
      her attitude of absolute repose, that the younger woman felt the awfullest
      sense of responsibility at her Vandalism in having undertaken to demolish
      so imposing a pile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady's jewelled ornaments were taken off in silence&mdash;some by her
      own listless hands, some by Cytherea's. Then followed the outer stratum of
      clothing. The dress being removed, Cytherea took it in her hand and went
      with it into the bedroom adjoining, intending to hang it in the wardrobe.
      But on second thoughts, in order that she might not keep Miss Aldclyffe
      waiting a moment longer than necessary, she flung it down on the first
      resting-place that came to hand, which happened to be the bed, and
      re-entered the dressing-room with the noiseless footfall of a kitten. She
      paused in the middle of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was unnoticed, and her sudden return had plainly not been expected.
      During the short time of Cytherea's absence, Miss Aldclyffe had pulled off
      a kind of chemisette of Brussels net, drawn high above the throat, which
      she had worn with her evening dress as a semi-opaque covering to her
      shoulders, and in its place had put her night-gown round her. Her right
      hand was lifted to her neck, as if engaged in fastening her night-gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on a second glance Miss Aldclyffe's proceeding was clearer to
      Cytherea. She was not fastening her night-gown; it had been carelessly
      thrown round her, and Miss Aldclyffe was really occupied in holding up to
      her eyes some small object that she was keenly scrutinizing. And now on
      suddenly discovering the presence of Cytherea at the back of the
      apartment, instead of naturally continuing or concluding her inspection,
      she desisted hurriedly; the tiny snap of a spring was heard, her hand was
      removed, and she began adjusting her robes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modesty might have directed her hasty action of enwrapping her shoulders,
      but it was scarcely likely, considering Miss Aldclyffe's temperament, that
      she had all her life been used to a maid, Cytherea's youth, and the elder
      lady's marked treatment of her as if she were a mere child or plaything.
      The matter was too slight to reason about, and yet upon the whole it
      seemed that Miss Aldclyffe must have a practical reason for concealing her
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a timid sense of being an intruder Cytherea was about to step back
      and out of the room; but at the same moment Miss Aldclyffe turned, saw the
      impulse, and told her companion to stay, looking into her eyes as if she
      had half an intention to explain something. Cytherea felt certain it was
      the little mystery of her late movements. The other withdrew her eyes;
      Cytherea went to fetch the dressing-gown, and wheeled round again to bring
      it up to Miss Aldclyffe, who had now partly removed her night-dress to put
      it on the proper way, and still sat with her back towards Cytherea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her neck was again quite open and uncovered, and though hidden from the
      direct line of Cytherea's vision, she saw it reflected in the glass&mdash;the
      fair white surface, and the inimitable combination of curves between
      throat and bosom which artists adore, being brightly lit up by the light
      burning on either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the lady's prior proceedings were now explained in the simplest
      manner. In the midst of her breast, like an island in a sea of pearl,
      reclined an exquisite little gold locket, embellished with arabesque work
      of blue, red, and white enamel. That was undoubtedly what Miss Aldclyffe
      had been contemplating; and, moreover, not having been put off with her
      other ornaments, it was to be retained during the night&mdash;a slight
      departure from the custom of ladies which Miss Aldclyffe had at first not
      cared to exhibit to her new assistant, though now, on further thought, she
      seemed to have become indifferent on the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My dressing-gown,' she said, quietly fastening her night-dress as she
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea came forward with it. Miss Aldclyffe did not turn her head, but
      looked inquiringly at her maid in the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You saw what I wear on my neck, I suppose?' she said to Cytherea's
      reflected face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, madam, I did,' said Cytherea to Miss Aldclyffe's reflected face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe again looked at Cytherea's reflection as if she were on the
      point of explaining. Again she checked her resolve, and said lightly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Few of my maids discover that I wear it always. I generally keep it a
      secret&mdash;not that it matters much. But I was careless with you, and
      seemed to want to tell you. You win me to make confidences that....'
    </p>
    <p>
      She ceased, took Cytherea's hand in her own, lifted the locket with the
      other, touched the spring and disclosed a miniature.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is a handsome face, is it not?' she whispered mournfully, and even
      timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sight had gone through Cytherea like an electric shock, and there
      was an instantaneous awakening of perception in her, so thrilling in its
      presence as to be well-nigh insupportable. The face in the miniature was
      the face of her own father&mdash;younger and fresher than she had ever
      known him&mdash;but her father!
    </p>
    <p>
      Was this the woman of his wild and unquenchable early love? And was this
      the woman who had figured in the gate-man's story as answering the name of
      Cytherea before her judgment was awake? Surely it was. And if so, here was
      the tangible outcrop of a romantic and hidden stratum of the past hitherto
      seen only in her imagination; but as far as her scope allowed, clearly
      defined therein by reason of its strangeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe's eyes and thoughts were so intent upon the miniature that
      she had not been conscious of Cytherea's start of surprise. She went on
      speaking in a low and abstracted tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I lost him.' She interrupted her words by a short meditation, and
      went on again. 'I lost him by excess of honesty as regarded my past. But
      it was best that it should be so.... I was led to think rather more than
      usual of the circumstances to-night because of your name. It is pronounced
      the same way, though differently spelt.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The only means by which Cytherea's surname could have been spelt to Miss
      Aldclyffe must have been by Mrs. Morris or Farmer Springrove. She fancied
      Farmer Springrove would have spelt it properly if Edward was his
      informant, which made Miss Aldclyffe's remark obscure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Women make confidences and then regret them. The impulsive rush of feeling
      which had led Miss Aldclyffe to indulge in this revelation, trifling as it
      was, died out immediately her words were beyond recall; and the turmoil,
      occasioned in her by dwelling upon that chapter of her life, found vent in
      another kind of emotion&mdash;the result of a trivial accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea, after letting down Miss Aldclyffe's hair, adopted some plan with
      it to which the lady had not been accustomed. A rapid revulsion to
      irritation ensued. The maiden's mere touch seemed to discharge the pent-up
      regret of the lady as if she had been a jar of electricity.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How strangely you treat my hair!' she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have told you what I never tell my maids as a rule; of course <i>nothing</i>
      that I say in this room is to be mentioned outside it.' She spoke crossly
      no less than emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It shall not be, madam,' said Cytherea, agitated and vexed that the woman
      of her romantic wonderings should be so disagreeable to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why on earth did I tell you of my past?' she went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady's vexation with herself, and the accident which had led to the
      disclosure swelled little by little till it knew no bounds. But what was
      done could not be undone, and though Cytherea had shown a most winning
      responsiveness, quarrel Miss Aldclyffe must. She recurred to the subject
      of Cytherea's want of expertness, like a bitter reviewer, who finding the
      sentiments of a poet unimpeachable, quarrels with his rhymes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never, never before did I serve myself such a trick as this in engaging a
      maid!' She waited for an expostulation: none came. Miss Aldclyffe tried
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The idea of my taking a girl without asking her more than three
      questions, or having a single reference, all because of her good l&mdash;,
      the shape of her face and body! It <i>was</i> a fool's trick. There, I am
      served right, quite right&mdash;by being deceived in such a way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I didn't deceive you,' said Cytherea. The speech was an unfortunate one,
      and was the very 'fuel to maintain its fires' that the other's petulance
      desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You did,' she said hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I told you I couldn't promise to be acquainted with every detail of
      routine just at first.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will you contradict me in this way! You are telling untruths, I say.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea's lip quivered. 'I would answer the remark if&mdash;if&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If what?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If it were a lady's!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You girl of impudence&mdash;what do you say? Leave the room this instant,
      I tell you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I tell you that a person who speaks to a lady as you do to me, is no
      lady herself!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'To a lady? A lady's-maid speaks in this way. The idea!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't "lady's-maid" me: nobody is my mistress I won't have it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good Heavens!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wouldn't have come&mdash;no&mdash;I wouldn't! if I had known!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That you were such an ill-tempered, unjust woman!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Possest beyond the Muse's painting,' Miss Aldclyffe exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'A Woman, am I! I'll teach you if I am a Woman!' and lifted her hand as if
      she would have liked to strike her companion. This stung the maiden into
      absolute defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I dare you to touch me!' she cried. 'Strike me if you dare, madam! I am
      not afraid of you&mdash;what do you mean by such an action as that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe was disconcerted at this unexpected show of spirit, and
      ashamed of her unladylike impulse now it was put into words. She sank back
      in the chair. 'I was not going to strike you&mdash;go to your room&mdash;I
      beg you to go to your room!' she repeated in a husky whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea, red and panting, took up her candlestick and advanced to the
      table to get a light. As she stood close to them the rays from the candles
      struck sharply on her face. She usually bore a much stronger likeness to
      her mother than to her father, but now, looking with a grave, reckless,
      and angered expression of countenance at the kindling wick as she held it
      slanting into the other flame, her father's features were distinct in her.
      It was the first time Miss Aldclyffe had seen her in a passionate mood,
      and wearing that expression which was invariably its concomitant. It was
      Miss Aldclyffe's turn to start now; and the remark she made was an
      instance of that sudden change of tone from high-flown invective to the
      pettiness of curiosity which so often makes women's quarrels ridiculous.
      Even Miss Aldclyffe's dignity had not sufficient power to postpone the
      absorbing desire she now felt to settle the strange suspicion that had
      entered her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You spell your name the common way, G, R, E, Y, don't you?' she said,
      with assumed indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' said Cytherea, poised on the side of her foot, and still looking
      into the flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, surely? The name was spelt that way on your boxes: I looked and saw
      it myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The enigma of Miss Aldclyffe's mistake was solved. 'O, was it?' said
      Cytherea. 'Ah, I remember Mrs. Jackson, the lodging-house keeper at
      Budmouth, labelled them. We spell our name G, R, A, Y, E.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What was your father's trade?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea thought it would be useless to attempt to conceal facts any
      longer. 'His was not a trade,' she said. 'He was an architect.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The idea of your being an architect's daughter!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's nothing to offend you in that, I hope?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why did you say "the idea"?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Leave that alone. Did he ever visit in Gower Street, Bloomsbury, one
      Christmas, many years ago?&mdash;but you would not know that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have heard him say that Mr. Huntway, a curate somewhere in that part of
      London, and who died there, was an old college friend of his.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is your Christian name?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cytherea.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No! And is it really? And you knew that face I showed you? Yes, I see you
      did.' Miss Aldclyffe stopped, and closed her lips impassibly. She was a
      little agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you want me any longer?' said Cytherea, standing candle in hand and
      looking quietly in Miss Aldclyffe's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well&mdash;no: no longer,' said the other lingeringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'With your permission, I will leave the house to morrow morning, madam.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah.' Miss Aldclyffe had no notion of what she was saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I know you will be so good as not to intrude upon me during the short
      remainder of my stay?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Saying this Cytherea left the room before her companion had answered. Miss
      Aldclyffe, then, had recognized her at last, and had been curious about
      her name from the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other members of the household had retired to rest. As Cytherea went
      along the passage leading to her room her skirts rustled against the
      partition. A door on her left opened, and Mrs. Morris looked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I waited out of bed till you came up,' she said, 'it being your first
      night, in case you should be at a loss for anything. How have you got on
      with Miss Aldclyffe?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pretty well&mdash;though not so well as I could have wished.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Has she been scolding?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A little.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She's a very odd lady&mdash;'tis all one way or the other with her. She's
      not bad at heart, but unbearable in close quarters. Those of us who don't
      have much to do with her personally, stay on for years and years.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Has Miss Aldclyffe's family always been rich?' said Cytherea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no. The property, with the name, came from her mother's uncle. Her
      family is a branch of the old Aldclyffe family on the maternal side. Her
      mother married a Bradleigh&mdash;a mere nobody at that time&mdash;and was
      on that account cut by her relations. But very singularly the other branch
      of the family died out one by one&mdash;three of them, and Miss
      Aldclyffe's great-uncle then left all his property, including this estate,
      to Captain Bradleigh and his wife&mdash;Miss Aldclyffe's father and mother&mdash;on
      condition that they took the old family name as well. There's all about it
      in the "Landed Gentry." 'Tis a thing very often done.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, I see. Thank you. Well, now I am going. Good-night.'

      VI. THE EVENTS OF TWELVE HOURS
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1. AUGUST THE NINTH. ONE TO TWO O'CLOCK A.M.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Cytherea entered her bedroom, and flung herself on the bed, bewildered by
      a whirl of thought. Only one subject was clear in her mind, and it was
      that, in spite of family discoveries, that day was to be the first and
      last of her experience as a lady's-maid. Starvation itself should not
      compel her to hold such a humiliating post for another instant. 'Ah,' she
      thought, with a sigh, at the martyrdom of her last little fragment of
      self-conceit, 'Owen knows everything better than I.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She jumped up and began making ready for her departure in the morning, the
      tears streaming down when she grieved and wondered what practical matter
      on earth she could turn her hand to next. All these preparations
      completed, she began to undress, her mind unconsciously drifting away to
      the contemplation of her late surprises. To look in the glass for an
      instant at the reflection of her own magnificent resources in face and
      bosom, and to mark their attractiveness unadorned, was perhaps but the
      natural action of a young woman who had so lately been chidden whilst
      passing through the harassing experience of decorating an older beauty of
      Miss Aldclyffe's temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she directly checked her weakness by sympathizing reflections on the
      hidden troubles which must have thronged the past years of the solitary
      lady, to keep her, though so rich and courted, in a mood so repellent and
      gloomy as that in which Cytherea found her; and then the young girl
      marvelled again and again, as she had marvelled before, at the strange
      confluence of circumstances which had brought herself into contact with
      the one woman in the world whose history was so romantically intertwined
      with her own. She almost began to wish she were not obliged to go away and
      leave the lonely being to loneliness still.
    </p>
    <p>
      In bed and in the dark, Miss Aldclyffe haunted her mind more persistently
      than ever. Instead of sleeping, she called up staring visions of the
      possible past of this queenly lady, her mother's rival. Up the long vista
      of bygone years she saw, behind all, the young girl's flirtation, little
      or much, with the cousin, that seemed to have been nipped in the bud, or
      to have terminated hastily in some way. Then the secret meetings between
      Miss Aldclyffe and the other woman at the little inn at Hammersmith and
      other places: the commonplace name she adopted: her swoon at some painful
      news, and the very slight knowledge the elder female had of her partner in
      mystery. Then, more than a year afterwards, the acquaintanceship of her
      own father with this his first love; the awakening of the passion, his
      acts of devotion, the unreasoning heat of his rapture, her tacit
      acceptance of it, and yet her uneasiness under the delight. Then his
      declaration amid the evergreens: the utter change produced in her manner
      thereby, seemingly the result of a rigid determination: and the total
      concealment of her reason by herself and her parents, whatever it was.
      Then the lady's course dropped into darkness, and nothing more was visible
      till she was discovered here at Knapwater, nearly fifty years old, still
      unmarried and still beautiful, but lonely, embittered, and haughty.
      Cytherea imagined that her father's image was still warmly cherished in
      Miss Aldclyffe's heart, and was thankful that she herself had not been
      betrayed into announcing that she knew many particulars of this page of
      her father's history, and the chief one, the lady's unaccountable
      renunciation of him. It would have made her bearing towards the mistress
      of the mansion more awkward, and would have been no benefit to either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus conjuring up the past, and theorizing on the present, she lay
      restless, changing her posture from one side to the other and back again.
      Finally, when courting sleep with all her art, she heard a clock strike
      two. A minute later, and she fancied she could distinguish a soft rustle
      in the passage outside her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      To bury her head in the sheets was her first impulse; then to uncover it,
      raise herself on her elbow, and stretch her eyes wide open in the
      darkness; her lips being parted with the intentness of her listening.
      Whatever the noise was, it had ceased for the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It began again and came close to her door, lightly touching the panels.
      Then there was another stillness; Cytherea made a movement which caused a
      faint rustling of the bed-clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before she had time to think another thought a light tap was given.
      Cytherea breathed: the person outside was evidently bent upon finding her
      awake, and the rustle she had made had encouraged the hope. The maiden's
      physical condition shifted from one pole to its opposite. The cold sweat
      of terror forsook her, and modesty took the alarm. She became hot and red;
      her door was not locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      A distinct woman's whisper came to her through the keyhole: 'Cytherea!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Only one being in the house knew her Christian name, and that was Miss
      Aldclyffe. Cytherea stepped out of bed, went to the door, and whispered
      back, 'Yes?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let me come in, darling.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The young woman paused in a conflict between judgment and emotion. It was
      now mistress and maid no longer; woman and woman only. Yes; she must let
      her come in, poor thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got a light in an instant, opened the door, and raising her eyes and
      the candle, saw Miss Aldclyffe standing outside in her dressing-gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now you see that it is really myself; put out the light,' said the
      visitor. 'I want to stay here with you, Cythie. I came to ask you to come
      down into my bed, but it is snugger here. But remember that you are
      mistress in this room, and that I have no business here, and that you may
      send me away if you choose. Shall I go?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no; you shan't indeed if you don't want to,' said Cythie generously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instant they were in bed Miss Aldclyffe freed herself from the last
      remnant of restraint. She flung her arms round the young girl, and pressed
      her gently to her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now kiss me,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea, upon the whole, was rather discomposed at this change of
      treatment; and, discomposed or no, her passions were not so impetuous as
      Miss Aldclyffe's. She could not bring her soul to her lips for a moment,
      try how she would.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come, kiss me,' repeated Miss Aldclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea gave her a very small one, as soft in touch and in sound as the
      bursting of a bubble.
    </p>
    <p>
      'More earnestly than that&mdash;come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave another, a little but not much more expressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't deserve a more feeling one, I suppose,' said Miss Aldclyffe, with
      an emphasis of sad bitterness in her tone. 'I am an ill-tempered woman,
      you think; half out of my mind. Well, perhaps I am; but I have had grief
      more than you can think or dream of. But I can't help loving you&mdash;your
      name is the same as mine&mdash;isn't it strange?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea was inclined to say no, but remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, don't you think I must love you?' continued the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said Cytherea absently. She was still thinking whether duty to Owen
      and her father, which asked for silence on her knowledge of her father's
      unfortunate love, or duty to the woman embracing her, which seemed to ask
      for confidence, ought to predominate. Here was a solution. She would wait
      till Miss Aldclyffe referred to her acquaintanceship and attachment to
      Cytherea's father in past times: then she would tell her all she knew:
      that would be honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why can't you kiss me as I can kiss you? Why can't you!' She impressed
      upon Cytherea's lips a warm motherly salute, given as if in the outburst
      of strong feeling, long checked, and yearning for something to love and be
      loved by in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you think badly of me for my behaviour this evening, child? I don't
      know why I am so foolish as to speak to you in this way. I am a very fool,
      I believe. Yes. How old are you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Eighteen.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Eighteen!... Well, why don't you ask me how old I am?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because I don't want to know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind if you don't. I am forty-six; and it gives me greater pleasure
      to tell you this than it does to you to listen. I have not told my age
      truly for the last twenty years till now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why haven't you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have met deceit by deceit, till I am weary of it&mdash;weary, weary&mdash;and
      I long to be what I shall never be again&mdash;artless and innocent, like
      you. But I suppose that you, too, will, prove to be not worth a thought,
      as every new friend does on more intimate knowledge. Come, why don't you
      talk to me, child? Have you said your prayers?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes&mdash;no! I forgot them to-night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose you say them every night as a rule?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why do you do that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because I have always done so, and it would seem strange if I were not
      to. Do you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I? A wicked old sinner like me! No, I never do. I have thought all such
      matters humbug for years&mdash;thought so so long that I should be glad to
      think otherwise from very weariness; and yet, such is the code of the
      polite world, that I subscribe regularly to Missionary Societies and
      others of the sort.... Well, say your prayers, dear&mdash;you won't omit
      them now you recollect it. I should like to hear you very much. Will you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It seems hardly&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It would seem so like old times to me&mdash;when I was young, and nearer&mdash;far
      nearer Heaven than I am now. Do, sweet one,'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea was embarrassed, and her embarrassment arose from the following
      conjuncture of affairs. Since she had loved Edward Springrove, she had
      linked his name with her brother Owen's in her nightly supplications to
      the Almighty. She wished to keep her love for him a secret, and, above
      all, a secret from a woman like Miss Aldclyffe; yet her conscience and the
      honesty of her love would not for an instant allow her to think of
      omitting his dear name, and so endanger the efficacy of all her previous
      prayers for his success by an unworthy shame now: it would be wicked of
      her, she thought, and a grievous wrong to him. Under any worldly
      circumstances she might have thought the position justified a little
      finesse, and have skipped him for once; but prayer was too solemn a thing
      for such trifling.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I would rather not say them,' she murmured first. It struck her then that
      this declining altogether was the same cowardice in another dress, and was
      delivering her poor Edward over to Satan just as unceremoniously as
      before. 'Yes; I will say my prayers, and you shall hear me,' she added
      firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her face to the pillow and repeated in low soft tones the
      simple words she had used from childhood on such occasions. Owen's name
      was mentioned without faltering, but in the other case, maidenly shyness
      was too strong even for religion, and that when supported by excellent
      intentions. At the name of Edward she stammered, and her voice sank to the
      faintest whisper in spite of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you, dearest,' said Miss Aldclyffe. 'I have prayed too, I verily
      believe. You are a good girl, I think.' Then the expected question came.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Bless Owen," and whom, did you say?'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no help for it now, and out it came. 'Owen and Edward,' said
      Cytherea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who are Owen and Edward?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Owen is my brother, madam,' faltered the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, I remember. Who is Edward?'
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your brother, too?' continued Miss Aldclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe reflected a moment. 'Don't you want to tell me who Edward
      is?' she said at last, in a tone of meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't mind telling; only....'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You would rather not, I suppose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe shifted her ground. 'Were you ever in love?' she inquired
      suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea was surprised to hear how quickly the voice had altered from
      tenderness to harshness, vexation, and disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes&mdash;I think I was&mdash;once,' she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Aha! And were you ever kissed by a man?'
    </p>
    <p>
      A pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, were you?' said Miss Aldclyffe, rather sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't press me to tell&mdash;I can't&mdash;indeed, I won't, madam!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe removed her arms from Cytherea's neck. ''Tis now with you
      as it is always with all girls,' she said, in jealous and gloomy accents.
      'You are not, after all, the innocent I took you for. No, no.' She then
      changed her tone with fitful rapidity. 'Cytherea, try to love me more than
      you love him&mdash;do. I love you more sincerely than any man can. Do,
      Cythie: don't let any man stand between us. O, I can't bear that!' She
      clasped Cytherea's neck again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I must love him now I have begun,' replied the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Must&mdash;yes&mdash;must,' said the elder lady reproachfully. 'Yes,
      women are all alike. I thought I had at last found an artless woman who
      had not been sullied by a man's lips, and who had not practised or been
      practised upon by the arts which ruin all the truth and sweetness and
      goodness in us. Find a girl, if you can, whose mouth and ears have not
      been made a regular highway of by some man or another! Leave the
      admittedly notorious spots&mdash;the drawing-rooms of society&mdash;and
      look in the villages&mdash;leave the villages and search in the schools&mdash;and
      you can hardly find a girl whose heart has not been <i>had</i>&mdash;is
      not an old thing half worn out by some He or another! If men only knew the
      staleness of the freshest of us! that nine times out of ten the "first
      love" they think they are winning from a woman is but the hulk of an old
      wrecked affection, fitted with new sails and re-used. O Cytherea, can it
      be that you, too, are like the rest?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no, no,' urged Cytherea, awed by the storm she had raised in the
      impetuous woman's mind. 'He only kissed me once&mdash;twice I mean.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He might have done it a thousand times if he had cared to, there's no
      doubt about that, whoever his lordship is. You are as bad as I&mdash;we
      are all alike; and I&mdash;an old fool&mdash;have been sipping at your
      mouth as if it were honey, because I fancied no wasting lover knew the
      spot. But a minute ago, and you seemed to me like a fresh spring meadow&mdash;now
      you seem a dusty highway.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no, no!' Cytherea was not weak enough to shed tears except on
      extraordinary occasions, but she was fain to begin sobbing now. She wished
      Miss Aldclyffe would go to her own room, and leave her and her treasured
      dreams alone. This vehement imperious affection was in one sense soothing,
      but yet it was not of the kind that Cytherea's instincts desired. Though
      it was generous, it seemed somewhat too rank and capricious for endurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' said the lady in continuation, 'who is he?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her companion was desperately determined not to tell his name: she too
      much feared a taunt when Miss Aldclyffe's fiery mood again ruled her
      tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Won't you tell me? not tell me after all the affection I have shown?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will, perhaps, another day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you wear a hat and white feather in Budmouth for the week or two
      previous to your coming here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I have seen you and your lover at a distance! He rowed you round the
      bay with your brother.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And without your brother&mdash;fie! There, there, don't let that little
      heart beat itself to death: throb, throb: it shakes the bed, you silly
      thing. I didn't mean that there was any harm in going alone with him. I
      only saw you from the Esplanade, in common with the rest of the people. I
      often run down to Budmouth. He was a very good figure: now who was he?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I&mdash;I won't tell, madam&mdash;I cannot indeed!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Won't tell&mdash;very well, don't. You are very foolish to treasure up
      his name and image as you do. Why, he has had loves before you, trust him
      for that, whoever he is, and you are but a temporary link in a long chain
      of others like you: who only have your little day as they have had
      theirs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tisn't true! 'tisn't true! 'tisn't true!' cried Cytherea in an agony of
      torture. 'He has never loved anybody else, I know&mdash;I am sure he
      hasn't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe was as jealous as any man could have been. She continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'He sees a beautiful face and thinks he will never forget it, but in a few
      weeks the feeling passes off, and he wonders how he could have cared for
      anybody so absurdly much.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no, he doesn't&mdash;What does he do when he has thought that&mdash;Come,
      tell me&mdash;tell me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are as hot as fire, and the throbbing of your heart makes me nervous.
      I can't tell you if you get in that flustered state.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do, do tell&mdash;O, it makes me so miserable! but tell&mdash;come tell
      me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah&mdash;the tables are turned now, dear!' she continued, in a tone which
      mingled pity with derision&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   '"Love's passions shall rock thee
    As the storm rocks the ravens on high,
    Bright reason will mock thee
    Like the sun from a wintry sky."
</pre>
    <p>
      'What does he do next?&mdash;Why, this is what he does next: ruminate on
      what he has heard of women's romantic impulses, and how easily men torture
      them when they have given way to those feelings, and have resigned
      everything for their hero. It may be that though he loves you heartily now&mdash;that
      is, as heartily as a man can&mdash;and you love him in return, your loves
      may be impracticable and hopeless, and you may be separated for ever. You,
      as the weary, weary years pass by will fade and fade&mdash;bright eyes <i>will</i>
      fade&mdash;and you will perhaps then die early&mdash;true to him to your
      latest breath, and believing him to be true to the latest breath also;
      whilst he, in some gay and busy spot far away from your last quiet nook,
      will have married some dashing lady, and not purely oblivious of you, will
      long have ceased to regret you&mdash;will chat about you, as you were in
      long past years&mdash;will say, "Ah, little Cytherea used to tie her hair
      like that&mdash;poor innocent trusting thing; it was a pleasant useless
      idle dream&mdash;that dream of mine for the maid with the bright eyes and
      simple, silly heart; but I was a foolish lad at that time." Then he will
      tell the tale of all your little Wills and Wont's and particular ways, and
      as he speaks, turn to his wife with a placid smile.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is not true! He can't, he c-can't be s-so cruel&mdash;and you are
      cruel to me&mdash;you are, you are!' She was at last driven to
      desperation: her natural common sense and shrewdness had seen all through
      the piece how imaginary her emotions were&mdash;she felt herself to be
      weak and foolish in permitting them to rise; but even then she could not
      control them: be agonized she must. She was only eighteen, and the long
      day's labour, her weariness, her excitement, had completely unnerved her,
      and worn her out: she was bent hither and thither by this tyrannical
      working upon her imagination, as a young rush in the wind. She wept
      bitterly. 'And now think how much I like you,' resumed Miss Aldclyffe,
      when Cytherea grew calmer. 'I shall never forget you for anybody else, as
      men do&mdash;never. I will be exactly as a mother to you. Now will you
      promise to live with me always, and always be taken care of, and never
      deserted?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot. I will not be anybody's maid for another day on any
      consideration.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no, no. You shan't be a lady's-maid. You shall be my companion. I
      will get another maid.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Companion&mdash;that was a new idea. Cytherea could not resist the
      evidently heartfelt desire of the strange-tempered woman for her presence.
      But she could not trust to the moment's impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will stay, I think. But do not ask for a final answer to-night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind now, then. Put your hair round your mamma's neck, and give me
      one good long kiss, and I won't talk any more in that way about your
      lover. After all, some young men are not so fickle as others; but even if
      he's the ficklest, there is consolation. The love of an inconstant man is
      ten times more ardent than that of a faithful man&mdash;that is, while it
      lasts.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea did as she was told, to escape the punishment of further talk;
      flung the twining tresses of her long, rich hair over Miss Aldclyffe's
      shoulders as directed, and the two ceased conversing, making themselves up
      for sleep. Miss Aldclyffe seemed to give herself over to a luxurious sense
      of content and quiet, as if the maiden at her side afforded her a
      protection against dangers which had menaced her for years; she was soon
      sleeping calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. TWO TO FIVE A.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Cytherea it was otherwise. Unused to the place and circumstances, she
      continued wakeful, ill at ease, and mentally distressed. She withdrew
      herself from her companion's embrace, turned to the other side, and
      endeavoured to relieve her busy brain by looking at the window-blind, and
      noticing the light of the rising moon&mdash;now in her last quarter&mdash;creep
      round upon it: it was the light of an old waning moon which had but a few
      days longer to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight led her to think again of what had happened under the rays of
      the same month's moon, a little before its full, the ecstatic evening
      scene with Edward: the kiss, and the shortness of those happy moments&mdash;maiden
      imagination bringing about the apotheosis of a status quo which had had
      several unpleasantnesses in its earthly reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      But sounds were in the ascendant that night. Her ears became aware of a
      strange and gloomy murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      She recognized it: it was the gushing of the waterfall, faint and low,
      brought from its source to the unwonted distance of the House by a faint
      breeze which made it distinct and recognizable by reason of the utter
      absence of all disturbing sounds. The groom's melancholy representation
      lent to the sound a more dismal effect than it would have had of its own
      nature. She began to fancy what the waterfall must be like at that hour,
      under the trees in the ghostly moonlight. Black at the head, and over the
      surface of the deep cold hole into which it fell; white and frothy at the
      fall; black and white, like a pall and its border; sad everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was in the mood for sounds of every kind now, and strained her ears to
      catch the faintest, in wayward enmity to her quiet of mind. Another soon
      came.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second was quite different from the first&mdash;a kind of intermittent
      whistle it seemed primarily: no, a creak, a metallic creak, ever and anon,
      like a plough, or a rusty wheelbarrow, or at least a wheel of some kind.
      Yes, it was, a wheel&mdash;the water-wheel in the shrubbery by the old
      manor-house, which the coachman had said would drive him mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      She determined not to think any more of these gloomy things; but now that
      she had once noticed the sound there was no sealing her ears to it. She
      could not help timing its creaks, and putting on a dread expectancy just
      before the end of each half-minute that brought them. To imagine the
      inside of the engine-house, whence these noises proceeded, was now a
      necessity. No window, but crevices in the door, through which, probably,
      the moonbeams streamed in the most attenuated and skeleton-like rays,
      striking sharply upon portions of wet rusty cranks and chains; a
      glistening wheel, turning incessantly, labouring in the dark like a
      captive starving in a dungeon; and instead of a floor below, gurgling
      water, which on account of the darkness could only be heard; water which
      laboured up dark pipes almost to where she lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shivered. Now she was determined to go to sleep; there could be
      nothing else left to be heard or to imagine&mdash;it was horrid that her
      imagination should be so restless. Yet just for an instant before going to
      sleep she would think this&mdash;suppose another sound <i>should</i> come&mdash;just
      suppose it should! Before the thought had well passed through her brain, a
      third sound came.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third was a very soft gurgle or rattle&mdash;of a strange and abnormal
      kind&mdash;yet a sound she had heard before at some past period of her
      life&mdash;when, she could not recollect. To make it the more disturbing,
      it seemed to be almost close to her&mdash;either close outside the window,
      close under the floor, or close above the ceiling. The accidental fact of
      its coming so immediately upon the heels of her supposition, told so
      powerfully upon her excited nerves that she jumped up in the bed. The same
      instant, a little dog in some room near, having probably heard the same
      noise, set up a low whine. The watch-dog in the yard, hearing the moan of
      his associate, began to howl loudly and distinctly. His melancholy notes
      were taken up directly afterwards by the dogs in the kennel a long way
      off, in every variety of wail.
    </p>
    <p>
      One logical thought alone was able to enter her flurried brain. The little
      dog that began the whining must have heard the other two sounds even
      better than herself. He had taken no notice of them, but he had taken
      notice of the third. The third, then, was an unusual sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not like water, it was not like wind; it was not the night-jar, it
      was not a clock, nor a rat, nor a person snoring.
    </p>
    <p>
      She crept under the clothes, and flung her arms tightly round Miss
      Aldclyffe, as if for protection. Cytherea perceived that the lady's late
      peaceful warmth had given place to a sweat. At the maiden's touch, Miss
      Aldclyffe awoke with a low scream.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remembered her position instantly. 'O such a terrible dream!' she
      cried, in a hurried whisper, holding to Cytherea in her turn; 'and your
      touch was the end of it. It was dreadful. Time, with his wings,
      hour-glass, and scythe, coming nearer and nearer to me&mdash;grinning and
      mocking: then he seized me, took a piece of me only... But I can't tell
      you. I can't bear to think of it. How those dogs howl! People say it means
      death.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The return of Miss Aldclyffe to consciousness was sufficient to dispel the
      wild fancies which the loneliness of the night had woven in Cytherea's
      mind. She dismissed the third noise as something which in all likelihood
      could easily be explained, if trouble were taken to inquire into it: large
      houses had all kinds of strange sounds floating about them. She was
      ashamed to tell Miss Aldclyffe her terrors.
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence of five minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are you asleep?' said Miss Aldclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' said Cytherea, in a long-drawn whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How those dogs howl, don't they?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. A little dog in the house began it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, yes: that was Totsy. He sleeps on the mat outside my father's bedroom
      door. A nervous creature.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silent interval of nearly half-an-hour. A clock on the landing
      struck three.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are you asleep, Miss Aldclyffe?' whispered Cytherea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' said Miss Aldclyffe. 'How wretched it is not to be able to sleep,
      isn't it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' replied Cytherea, like a docile child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another hour passed, and the clock struck four. Miss Aldclyffe was still
      awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cytherea,' she said, very softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea made no answer. She was sleeping soundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first glimmer of dawn was now visible. Miss Aldclyffe arose, put on
      her dressing-gown, and went softly downstairs to her own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have not told her who I am after all, or found out the particulars of
      Ambrose's history,' she murmured. 'But her being in love alters
      everything.'
    </p>
    <p>
      3. HALF-PAST SEVEN TO TEN O'CLOCK A.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea awoke, quiet in mind and refreshed. A conclusion to remain at
      Knapwater was already in possession of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding Miss Aldclyffe gone, she dressed herself and sat down at the
      window to write an answer to Edward's letter, and an account of her
      arrival at Knapwater to Owen. The dismal and heart-breaking pictures that
      Miss Aldclyffe had placed before her the preceding evening, the later
      terrors of the night, were now but as shadows of shadows, and she smiled
      in derision at her own excitability.
    </p>
    <p>
      But writing Edward's letter was the great consoler, the effect of each
      word upon him being enacted in her own face as she wrote it. She felt how
      much she would like to share his trouble&mdash;how well she could endure
      poverty with him&mdash;and wondered what his trouble was. But all would be
      explained at last, she knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the appointed time she went to Miss Aldclyffe's room, intending, with
      the contradictoriness common in people, to perform with pleasure, as a
      work of supererogation, what as a duty was simply intolerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe was already out of bed. The bright penetrating light of
      morning made a vast difference in the elder lady's behaviour to her
      dependent; the day, which had restored Cytherea's judgment, had effected
      the same for Miss Aldclyffe. Though practical reasons forbade her
      regretting that she had secured such a companionable creature to read,
      talk, or play to her whenever her whim required, she was inwardly vexed at
      the extent to which she had indulged in the womanly luxury of making
      confidences and giving way to emotions. Few would have supposed that the
      calm lady sitting aristocratically at the toilet table, seeming scarcely
      conscious of Cytherea's presence in the room, even when greeting her, was
      the passionate creature who had asked for kisses a few hours before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is both painful and satisfactory to think how often these antitheses
      are to be observed in the individual most open to our observation&mdash;ourselves.
      We pass the evening with faces lit up by some flaring illumination or
      other: we get up the next morning&mdash;the fiery jets have all gone out,
      and nothing confronts us but a few crinkled pipes and sooty wirework,
      hardly even recalling the outline of the blazing picture that arrested our
      eyes before bedtime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emotions would be half starved if there were no candle-light. Probably
      nine-tenths of the gushing letters of indiscreet confession are written
      after nine or ten o'clock in the evening, and sent off before day returns
      to leer invidiously upon them. Few that remain open to catch our glance as
      we rise in the morning, survive the frigid criticism of dressing-time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subjects uppermost in the minds of the two women who had thus cooled
      from their fires, were not the visionary ones of the later hours, but the
      hard facts of their earlier conversation. After a remark that Cytherea
      need not assist her in dressing unless she wished to, Miss Aldclyffe said
      abruptly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can tell that young man's name.' She looked keenly at Cytherea. 'It is
      Edward Springrove, my tenant's son.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The inundation of colour upon the younger lady at hearing a name which to
      her was a world, handled as if it were only an atom, told Miss Aldclyffe
      that she had divined the truth at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah&mdash;it is he, is it?' she continued. 'Well, I wanted to know for
      practical reasons. His example shows that I was not so far wrong in my
      estimate of men after all, though I only generalized, and had no thought
      of him.' This was perfectly true.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do you mean?' said Cytherea, visibly alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mean? Why that all the world knows him to be engaged to be married, and
      that the wedding is soon to take place.' She made the remark bluntly and
      superciliously, as if to obtain absolution at the hands of her family
      pride for the weak confidences of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even the frigidity of Miss Aldclyffe's morning mood was overcome by
      the look of sick and blank despair which the carelessly uttered words had
      produced upon Cytherea's face. She sank back into a chair, and buried her
      face in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't be so foolish,' said Miss Aldclyffe. 'Come, make the best of it. I
      cannot upset the fact I have told you of, unfortunately. But I believe the
      match can be broken off.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no, no.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nonsense. I liked him much as a youth, and I like him now. I'll help you
      to captivate and chain him down. I have got over my absurd feeling of last
      night in not wanting you ever to go away from me&mdash;of course, I could
      not expect such a thing as that. There, now I have said I'll help you, and
      that's enough. He's tired of his first choice now that he's been away from
      home for a while. The love that no outer attack can frighten away quails
      before its idol's own homely ways; it is always so.... Come, finish what
      you are doing if you are going to, and don't be a little goose about such
      a trumpery affair as that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who&mdash;is he engaged to?' Cytherea inquired by a movement of her lips
      but no sound of her voice. But Miss Aldclyffe did not answer. It mattered
      not, Cytherea thought. Another woman&mdash;that was enough for her:
      curiosity was stunned.
    </p>
    <p>
      She applied herself to the work of dressing, scarcely knowing how. Miss
      Aldclyffe went on:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'You were too easily won. I'd have made him or anybody else speak out
      before he should have kissed my face for his pleasure. But you are one of
      those precipitantly fond things who are yearning to throw away their
      hearts upon the first worthless fellow who says good-morning. In the first
      place, you shouldn't have loved him so quickly: in the next, if you must
      have loved him off-hand, you should have concealed it. It tickled his
      vanity: "By Jove, that girl's in love with me already!" he thought.'
    </p>
    <p>
      To hasten away at the end of the toilet, to tell Mrs. Morris&mdash;who
      stood waiting in a little room prepared for her, with tea poured out,
      bread-and-butter cut into diaphanous slices, and eggs arranged&mdash;that
      she wanted no breakfast: then to shut herself alone in her bedroom, was
      her only thought. She was followed thither by the well-intentioned matron
      with a cup of tea and one piece of bread-and-butter on a tray, cheerfully
      insisting that she should eat it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To those who grieve, innocent cheerfulness seems heartless levity. 'No,
      thank you, Mrs. Morris,' she said, keeping the door closed. Despite the
      incivility of the action, Cytherea could not bear to let a pleasant person
      see her face then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediate revocation&mdash;even if revocation would be more effective by
      postponement&mdash;is the impulse of young wounded natures. Cytherea went
      to her blotting-book, took out the long letter so carefully written, so
      full of gushing remarks and tender hints, and sealed up so neatly with a
      little seal bearing 'Good Faith' as its motto, tore the missive into fifty
      pieces, and threw them into the grate. It was then the bitterest of
      anguishes to look upon some of the words she had so lovingly written, and
      see them existing only in mutilated forms without meaning&mdash;to feel
      that his eye would never read them, nobody ever know how ardently she had
      penned them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pity for one's self for being wasted is mostly present in these moods of
      abnegation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meaning of all his allusions, his abruptness in telling her of his
      love, his constraint at first, then his desperate manner of speaking, was
      clear. They must have been the last flickerings of a conscience not quite
      dead to all sense of perfidiousness and fickleness. Now he had gone to
      London: she would be dismissed from his memory, in the same way as Miss
      Aldclyffe had said. And here she was in Edward's own parish, reminded
      continually of him by what she saw and heard. The landscape, yesterday so
      much and so bright to her, was now but as the banquet-hall deserted&mdash;all
      gone but herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe had wormed her secret out of her, and would now be
      continually mocking her for her trusting simplicity in believing him. It
      was altogether unbearable: she would not stay there.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went downstairs and found Miss Aldclyffe had gone into the
      breakfast-room, but that Captain Aldclyffe, who rose later with increasing
      infirmities, had not yet made his appearance. Cytherea entered. Miss
      Aldclyffe was looking out of the window, watching a trail of white smoke
      along the distant landscape&mdash;signifying a passing train. At
      Cytherea's entry she turned and looked inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I must tell you now,' began Cytherea, in a tremulous voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, what?' Miss Aldclyffe said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am not going to stay with you. I must go away&mdash;a very long way. I
      am very sorry, but indeed I can't remain!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pooh&mdash;what shall we hear next?' Miss Aldclyffe surveyed Cytherea's
      face with leisurely criticism. 'You are breaking your heart again about
      that worthless young Springrove. I knew how it would be. It is as Hallam
      says of Juliet&mdash;what little reason you may have possessed originally
      has all been whirled away by this love. I shan't take this notice, mind.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do let me go!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe took her new pet's hand, and said with severity, 'As to
      hindering you, if you are determined to go, of course that's absurd. But
      you are not now in a state of mind fit for deciding upon any such
      proceeding, and I shall not listen to what you have to say. Now, Cythie,
      come with me; we'll let this volcano burst and spend itself, and after
      that we'll see what had better be done.' She took Cytherea into her
      workroom, opened a drawer, and drew forth a roll of linen.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This is some embroidery I began one day, and now I should like it
      finished.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She then preceded the maiden upstairs to Cytherea's own room. 'There,' she
      said, 'now sit down here, go on with this work, and remember one thing&mdash;that
      you are not to leave the room on any pretext whatever for two hours unless
      I send for you&mdash;I insist kindly, dear. Whilst you stitch&mdash;you
      are to stitch, recollect, and not go mooning out of the window&mdash;think
      over the whole matter, and get cooled; don't let the foolish love-affair
      prevent your thinking as a woman of the world. If at the end of that time
      you still say you must leave me, you may. I will have no more to say in
      the matter. Come, sit down, and promise to sit here the time I name.'
    </p>
    <p>
      To hearts in a despairing mood, compulsion seems a relief; and docility
      was at all times natural to Cytherea. She promised, and sat down. Miss
      Aldclyffe shut the door upon her and retreated.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sewed, stopped to think, shed a tear or two, recollected the articles
      of the treaty, and sewed again; and at length fell into a reverie which
      took no account whatever of the lapse of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. TEN TO TWELVE O'CLOCK A.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour might have passed when her thoughts became attracted
      from the past to the present by unwonted movements downstairs. She opened
      the door and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were hurryings along passages, opening and shutting of doors,
      trampling in the stable-yard. She went across into another bedroom, from
      which a view of the stable-yard could be obtained, and arrived there just
      in time to see the figure of the man who had driven her from the station
      vanishing down the coach-road on a black horse&mdash;galloping at the top
      of the animal's speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another man went off in the direction of the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever had occurred, it did not seem to be her duty to inquire or meddle
      with it, stranger and dependent as she was, unless she were requested to,
      especially after Miss Aldclyffe's strict charge to her. She sat down
      again, determined to let no idle curiosity influence her movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her window commanded the front of the house; and the next thing she saw
      was a clergyman walk up and enter the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was silent again till, a long time after the first man had left, he
      returned again on the same horse, now matted with sweat and trotting
      behind a carriage in which sat an elderly gentleman driven by a lad in
      livery. These came to the house, entered, and all was again the same as
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole household&mdash;master, mistress, and servants&mdash;appeared to
      have forgotten the very existence of such a being as Cytherea. She almost
      wished she had not vowed to have no idle curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-an-hour later, the carriage drove off with the elderly gentleman, and
      two or three messengers left the house, speeding in various directions.
      Rustics in smock-frocks began to hang about the road opposite the house,
      or lean against trees, looking idly at the windows and chimneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tap came to Cytherea's door. She opened it to a young maid-servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Aldclyffe wishes to see you, ma'am.' Cytherea hastened down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe was standing on the hearthrug, her elbow on the mantel, her
      hand to her temples, her eyes on the ground; perfectly calm, but very
      pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cytherea,' she said in a whisper, 'come here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea went close.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Something very serious has taken place,' she said again, and then paused,
      with a tremulous movement of her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said Cytherea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My father. He was found dead in his bed this morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dead!' echoed the younger woman. It seemed impossible that the
      announcement could be true; that knowledge of so great a fact could be
      contained in a statement so small.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, dead,' murmured Miss Aldclyffe solemnly. 'He died alone, though
      within a few feet of me. The room we slept in is exactly over his own.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea said hurriedly, 'Do they know at what hour?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The doctor says it must have been between two and three o'clock this
      morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I heard him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Heard him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Heard him die!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You heard him die? What did you hear?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A sound I heard once before in my life&mdash;at the deathbed of my
      mother. I could not identify it&mdash;though I recognized it. Then the dog
      howled: you remarked it. I did not think it worth while to tell you what I
      had heard a little earlier.' She looked agonized.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It would have been useless,' said Miss Aldclyffe. 'All was over by that
      time.' She addressed herself as much as Cytherea when she continued, 'Is
      it a Providence who sent you here at this juncture that I might not be
      left entirely alone?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Till this instant Miss Aldclyffe had forgotten the reason of Cytherea's
      seclusion in her own room. So had Cytherea herself. The fact now recurred
      to both in one moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you still wish to go?' said Miss Aldclyffe anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't want to go now,' Cytherea had remarked simultaneously with the
      other's question. She was pondering on the strange likeness which Miss
      Aldclyffe's bereavement bore to her own; it had the appearance of being
      still another call to her not to forsake this woman so linked to her life,
      for the sake of any trivial vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe held her almost as a lover would have held her, and said
      musingly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'We get more and more into one groove. I now am left fatherless and
      motherless as you were.' Other ties lay behind in her thoughts, but she
      did not mention them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You loved your father, Cytherea, and wept for him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I did. Poor papa!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was always at variance with mine, and can't weep for him now! But you
      must stay here always, and make a better woman of me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The compact was thus sealed, and Cytherea, in spite of the failure of her
      advertisements, was installed as a veritable Companion. And, once more in
      the history of human endeavour, a position which it was impossible to
      reach by any direct attempt, was come to by the seeker's swerving from the
      path, and regarding the original object as one of secondary importance.

    <h2>
      VII. THE EVENTS OF EIGHTEEN DAYS
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1. AUGUST THE SEVENTEENTH
    </h3>
    <p>
      The time of day was four o'clock in the afternoon. The place was the
      lady's study or boudoir, Knapwater House. The person was Miss Aldclyffe
      sitting there alone, clothed in deep mourning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The funeral of the old Captain had taken place, and his will had been
      read. It was very concise, and had been executed about five years previous
      to his death. It was attested by his solicitors, Messrs. Nyttleton and
      Tayling, of Lincoln's Inn Fields. The whole of his estate, real and
      personal, was bequeathed to his daughter Cytherea, for her sole and
      absolute use, subject only to the payment of a legacy to the rector, their
      relative, and a few small amounts to the servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe had not chosen the easiest chair of her boudoir to sit in,
      or even a chair of ordinary comfort, but an uncomfortable, high,
      narrow-backed, oak framed and seated chair, which was allowed to remain in
      the room only on the ground of being a companion in artistic quaintness to
      an old coffer beside it, and was never used except to stand in to reach
      for a book from the highest row of shelves. But she had sat erect in this
      chair for more than an hour, for the reason that she was utterly
      unconscious of what her actions and bodily feelings were. The chair had
      stood nearest her path on entering the room, and she had gone to it in a
      dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat in the attitude which denotes unflagging, intense, concentrated
      thought&mdash;as if she were cast in bronze. Her feet were together, her
      body bent a little forward, and quite unsupported by the back of the
      chair; her hands on her knees, her eyes fixed intently on the corner of a
      footstool.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she moved and tapped her fingers upon the table at her side. Her
      pent-up ideas had finally found some channel to advance in. Motions became
      more and more frequent as she laboured to carry further and further the
      problem which occupied her brain. She sat back and drew a long breath: she
      sat sideways and leant her forehead upon her hand. Later still she arose,
      walked up and down the room&mdash;at first abstractedly, with her features
      as firmly set as ever; but by degrees her brow relaxed, her footsteps
      became lighter and more leisurely; her head rode gracefully and was no
      longer bowed. She plumed herself like a swan after exertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' she said aloud. 'To get <i>him</i> here without letting him know
      that I have any other object than that of getting a useful man&mdash;that's
      the difficulty&mdash;and that I think I can master.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She rang for the new maid, a placid woman of forty with a few grey hairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ask Miss Graye if she can come to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea was not far off, and came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you know anything about architects and surveyors?' said Miss Aldclyffe
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Know anything?' replied Cytherea, poising herself on her toe to consider
      the compass of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes&mdash;know anything,' said Miss Aldclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Owen is an architect and surveyor's draughtsman,' the maiden said, and
      thought of somebody else who was likewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes! that's why I asked you. What are the different kinds of work
      comprised in an architect's practice? They lay out estates, and
      superintend the various works done upon them, I should think, among other
      things?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Those are, more properly, a land or building steward's duties&mdash;at
      least I have always imagined so. Country architects include those things
      in their practice; city architects don't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know that, child. But a steward's is an indefinite fast and loose
      profession, it seems to me. Shouldn't you think that a man who had been
      brought up as an architect would do for a steward?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea had doubts whether an architect pure would do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief pleasure connected with asking an opinion lies in not adopting
      it. Miss Aldclyffe replied decisively&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nonsense; of course he would. Your brother Owen makes plans for country
      buildings&mdash;such as cottages, stables, homesteads, and so on?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; he does.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And superintends the building of them?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; he will soon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And he surveys land?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And he knows about hedges and ditches&mdash;how wide they ought to be,
      boundaries, levelling, planting trees to keep away the winds, measuring
      timber, houses for ninety-nine years, and such things?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have never heard him say that; but I think Mr. Gradfield does those
      things. Owen, I am afraid, is inexperienced as yet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; your brother is not old enough for such a post yet, of course. And
      then there are rent-days, the audit and winding up of tradesmen's
      accounts. I am afraid, Cytherea, you don't know much more about the matter
      than I do myself.... I am going out just now,' she continued. 'I shall not
      want you to walk with me to-day. Run away till dinner-time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe went out of doors, and down the steps to the lawn: then
      turning to the left, through a shrubbery, she opened a wicket and passed
      into a neglected and leafy carriage-drive, leading down the hill. This she
      followed till she reached the point of its greatest depression, which was
      also the lowest ground in the whole grove.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trees here were so interlaced, and hung their branches so near the
      ground, that a whole summer's day was scarcely long enough to change the
      air pervading the spot from its normal state of coolness to even a
      temporary warmth. The unvarying freshness was helped by the nearness of
      the ground to the level of the springs, and by the presence of a deep,
      sluggish stream close by, equally well shaded by bushes and a high wall.
      Following the road, which now ran along at the margin of the stream, she
      came to an opening in the wall, on the other side of the water, revealing
      a large rectangular nook from which the stream proceeded, covered with
      froth, and accompanied by a dull roar. Two more steps, and she was
      opposite the nook, in full view of the cascade forming its further
      boundary. Over the top could be seen the bright outer sky in the form of a
      crescent, caused by the curve of a bridge across the rapids, and the trees
      above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beautiful as was the scene she did not look in that direction. The same
      standing-ground afforded another prospect, straight in the front, less
      sombre than the water on the right or the trees all around. The avenue and
      grove which flanked it abruptly terminated a few yards ahead, where the
      ground began to rise, and on the remote edge of the greensward thus laid
      open, stood all that remained of the original manor-house, to which the
      dark margin-line of the trees in the avenue formed an adequate and
      well-fitting frame. It was the picture thus presented that was now
      interesting Miss Aldclyffe&mdash;not artistically or historically, but
      practically&mdash;as regarded its fitness for adaptation to modern
      requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front, detached from everything else, rose the most ancient portion of
      the structure&mdash;an old arched gateway, flanked by the bases of two
      small towers, and nearly covered with creepers, which had clambered over
      the eaves of the sinking roof, and up the gable to the crest of the
      Aldclyffe family perched on the apex. Behind this, at a distance of ten or
      twenty yards, came the only portion of the main building that still
      existed&mdash;an Elizabethan fragment, consisting of as much as could be
      contained under three gables and a cross roof behind. Against the wall
      could be seen ragged lines indicating the form of other destroyed gables
      which had once joined it there. The mullioned and transomed windows,
      containing five or six lights, were mostly bricked up to the extent of two
      or three, and the remaining portion fitted with cottage window-frames
      carelessly inserted, to suit the purpose to which the old place was now
      applied, it being partitioned out into small rooms downstairs to form
      cottages for two labourers and their families; the upper portion was
      arranged as a storehouse for divers kinds of roots and fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The owner of the picturesque spot, after her survey from this point, went
      up to the walls and walked into the old court, where the paving-stones
      were pushed sideways and upwards by the thrust of the grasses between
      them. Two or three little children, with their fingers in their mouths,
      came out to look at her, and then ran in to tell their mothers in loud
      tones of secrecy that Miss Aldclyffe was coming. Miss Aldclyffe, however,
      did not come in. She concluded her survey of the exterior by making a
      complete circuit of the building; then turned into a nook a short distance
      off where round and square timber, a saw-pit, planks, grindstones, heaps
      of building stone and brick, explained that the spot was the centre of
      operations for the building work done on the estate.
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused, and looked around. A man who had seen her from the window of
      the workshops behind, came out and respectfully lifted his hat to her. It
      was the first time she had been seen walking outside the house since her
      father's death.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Strooden, could the Old House be made a decent residence of, without much
      trouble?' she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mechanic considered, and spoke as each consideration completed itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You don't forget, ma'am, that two-thirds of the place is already pulled
      down, or gone to ruin?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; I know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And that what's left may almost as well be, ma'am.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why may it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Twas so cut up inside when they made it into cottages, that the whole
      carcase is full of cracks.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Still by pulling down the inserted partitions, and adding a little
      outside, it could be made to answer the purpose of an ordinary six or
      eight-roomed house?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, ma'am.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'About what would it cost?' was the question which had invariably come
      next in every communication of this kind to which the superintending
      workman had been a party during his whole experience. To his surprise,
      Miss Aldclyffe did not put it. The man thought her object in altering an
      old house must have been an unusually absorbing one not to prompt what was
      so instinctive in owners as hardly to require any prompting at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you: that's sufficient, Strooden,' she said. 'You will understand
      that it is not unlikely some alteration may be made here in a short time,
      with reference to the management of the affairs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Strooden said 'Yes,' in a complex voice, and looked uneasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'During the life of Captain Aldclyffe, with you as the foreman of works,
      and he himself as his own steward, everything worked well. But now it may
      be necessary to have a steward, whose management will encroach further
      upon things which have hitherto been left in your hands than did your late
      master's. What I mean is, that he will directly and in detail superintend
      all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then&mdash;I shall not be wanted, ma'am?' he faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes; if you like to stay on as foreman in the yard and workshops only.
      I should be sorry to lose you. However, you had better consider. I will
      send for you in a few days.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving him to suspense, and all the ills that came in its train&mdash;distracted
      application to his duties, and an undefined number of sleepless nights and
      untasted dinners, Miss Aldclyffe looked at her watch and returned to the
      House. She was about to keep an appointment with her solicitor, Mr.
      Nyttleton, who had been to Budmouth, and was coming to Knapwater on his
      way back to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. AUGUST THE TWENTIETH
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Saturday subsequent to Mr. Nyttleton's visit to Knapwater House,
      the subjoined advertisement appeared in the Field and the Builder
      newspapers:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                     'LAND STEWARD.
</pre>
    <p>
      'A gentleman of integrity and professional skill is required immediately
      for the MANAGEMENT of an ESTATE, containing about 1000 acres, upon which
      agricultural improvements and the erection of buildings are contemplated.
      He must be a man of superior education, unmarried, and not more than
      thirty years of age. Considerable preference will be shown for one who
      possesses an artistic as well as a practical knowledge of planning and
      laying out. The remuneration will consist of a salary of 220 pounds, with
      the old manor-house as a residence&mdash;Address Messrs. Nyttleton and
      Tayling, solicitors, Lincoln's Inn Fields.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A copy of each paper was sent to Miss Aldclyffe on the day of publication.
      The same evening she told Cytherea that she was advertising for a steward,
      who would live at the old manor-house, showing her the papers containing
      the announcement.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the drift of that remark? thought the maiden; or was it merely
      made to her in confidential intercourse, as other arrangements were told
      her daily. Yet it seemed to have more meaning than common. She remembered
      the conversation about architects and surveyors, and her brother Owen.
      Miss Aldclyffe knew that his situation was precarious, that he was well
      educated and practical, and was applying himself heart and soul to the
      details of the profession and all connected with it. Miss Aldclyffe might
      be ready to take him if he could compete successfully with others who
      would reply. She hazarded a question:
    </p>
    <p>
      'Would it be desirable for Owen to answer it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not at all,' said Miss Aldclyffe peremptorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flat answer of this kind had ceased to alarm Cytherea. Miss Aldclyffe's
      blunt mood was not her worst. Cytherea thought of another man, whose name,
      in spite of resolves, tears, renunciations and injured pride, lingered in
      her ears like an old familiar strain. That man was qualified for a
      stewardship under a king.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Would it be of any use if Edward Springrove were to answer it?' she said,
      resolutely enunciating the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      'None whatever,' replied Miss Aldclyffe, again in the same decided tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are very unkind to speak in that way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now don't pout like a goosie, as you are. I don't want men like either of
      them, for, of course, I must look to the good of the estate rather than to
      that of any individual. The man I want must have been more specially
      educated. I have told you that we are going to London next week; it is
      mostly on this account.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea found that she had mistaken the drift of Miss Aldclyffe's
      peculiar explicitness on the subject of advertising, and wrote to tell her
      brother that if he saw the notice it would be useless to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. AUGUST THE TWENTY-FIFTH
    </p>
    <p>
      Five days after the above-mentioned dialogue took place they went to
      London, and, with scarcely a minute's pause, to the solicitors' offices in
      Lincoln's Inn Fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      They alighted opposite one of the characteristic entrances about the place&mdash;a
      gate which was never, and could never be, closed, flanked by
      lamp-standards carrying no lamp. Rust was the only active agent to be seen
      there at this time of the day and year. The palings along the front were
      rusted away at their base to the thinness of wires, and the successive
      coats of paint, with which they were overlaid in bygone days, had been
      completely undermined by the same insidious canker, which lifted off the
      paint in flakes, leaving the raw surface of the iron on palings,
      standards, and gate hinges, of a staring blood-red.
    </p>
    <p>
      But once inside the railings the picture changed. The court and offices
      were a complete contrast to the grand ruin of the outwork which enclosed
      them. Well-painted respectability extended over, within, and around the
      doorstep; and in the carefully swept yard not a particle of dust was
      visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Nyttleton, who had just come up from Margate, where he was staying
      with his family, was standing at the top of his own staircase as the pair
      ascended. He politely took them inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is there a comfortable room in which this young lady can sit during our
      interview?' said Miss Aldclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was rather a favourite habit of hers to make much of Cytherea when they
      were out, and snub her for it afterwards when they got home.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly&mdash;Mr. Tayling's.' Cytherea was shown into an inner room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Social definitions are all made relatively: an absolute datum is only
      imagined. The small gentry about Knapwater seemed unpractised to Miss
      Aldclyffe, Miss Aldclyffe herself seemed unpractised to Mr. Nyttleton's
      experienced old eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now then,' the lady said, when she was alone with the lawyer; 'what is
      the result of our advertisement?'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late summer; the estate-agency, building, engineering, and
      surveying worlds were dull. There were forty-five replies to the
      advertisement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Nyttleton spread them one by one before Miss Aldclyffe. 'You will
      probably like to read some of them yourself, madam?' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, certainly,' said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will not trouble you with those which are from persons manifestly unfit
      at first sight,' he continued; and began selecting from the heap twos and
      threes which he had marked, collecting others into his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The man we want lies among these, if my judgment doesn't deceive me, and
      from them it would be advisable to select a certain number to be
      communicated with.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should like to see every one&mdash;only just to glance them over&mdash;exactly
      as they came,' she said suasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked as if he thought this a waste of his time, but dismissing his
      sentiment unfolded each singly and laid it before her. As he laid them
      out, it struck him that she studied them quite as rapidly as he could
      spread them. He slyly glanced up from the outer corner of his eye to hers,
      and noticed that all she did was look at the name at the bottom of the
      letter, and then put the enclosure aside without further ceremony. He
      thought this an odd way of inquiring into the merits of forty-five men who
      at considerable trouble gave in detail reasons why they believed
      themselves well qualified for a certain post. She came to the final one,
      and put it down with the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the lady said that in her opinion it would be best to get as many
      replies as they possibly could before selecting&mdash;'to give us a wider
      choice. What do you think, Mr. Nyttleton?'
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to him, he said, that a greater number than those they already
      had would scarcely be necessary, and if they waited for more, there would
      be this disadvantage attending it, that some of those they now could
      command would possibly not be available.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind, we will run that risk,' said Miss Aldclyffe. 'Let the
      advertisement be inserted once more, and then we will certainly settle the
      matter.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Nyttleton bowed, and seemed to think Miss Aldclyffe, for a single
      woman, and one who till so very recently had never concerned herself with
      business of any kind, a very meddlesome client. But she was rich, and
      handsome still. 'She's a new broom in estate-management as yet,' he
      thought. 'She will soon get tired of this,' and he parted from her without
      a sentiment which could mar his habitual blandness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two ladies then proceeded westward. Dismissing the cab in Waterloo
      Place, they went along Pall Mall on foot, where in place of the usual
      well-dressed clubbists&mdash;rubicund with alcohol&mdash;were to be seen,
      in linen pinafores, flocks of house-painters pallid from white lead. When
      they had reached the Green Park, Cytherea proposed that they should sit
      down awhile under the young elms at the brow of the hill. This they did&mdash;the
      growl of Piccadilly on their left hand&mdash;the monastic seclusion of the
      Palace on their right: before them, the clock tower of the Houses of
      Parliament, standing forth with a metallic lustre against a livid Lambeth
      sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe still carried in her hand a copy of the newspaper, and
      while Cytherea had been interesting herself in the picture around, glanced
      again at the advertisement.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heaved a slight sigh, and began to fold it up again. In the action her
      eye caught sight of two consecutive advertisements on the cover, one
      relating to some lecture on Art, and addressed to members of the Institute
      of Architects. The other emanated from the same source, but was addressed
      to the public, and stated that the exhibition of drawings at the
      Institute's rooms would close at the end of that week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eye lighted up. She sent Cytherea back to the hotel in a cab, then
      turned round by Piccadilly into Bond Street, and proceeded to the rooms of
      the Institute. The secretary was sitting in the lobby. After making her
      payment, and looking at a few of the drawings on the walls, in the company
      of three gentlemen, the only other visitors to the exhibition, she turned
      back and asked if she might be allowed to see a list of the members. She
      was a little connected with the architectural world, she said, with a
      smile, and was interested in some of the names.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here it is, madam,' he replied, politely handing her a pamphlet
      containing the names.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe turned the leaves till she came to the letter M. The name
      she hoped to find there was there, with the address appended, as was the
      case with all the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The address was at some chambers in a street not far from Charing Cross.
      'Chambers,' as a residence, had always been assumed by the lady to imply
      the condition of a bachelor. She murmured two words, 'There still.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Another request had yet to be made, but it was of a more noticeable kind
      than the first, and might compromise the secrecy with which she wished to
      act throughout this episode. Her object was to get one of the envelopes
      lying on the secretary's table, stamped with the die of the Institute; and
      in order to get it she was about to ask if she might write a note.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the secretary's back chanced to be turned, and he now went towards one
      of the men at the other end of the room, who had called him to ask some
      question relating to an etching on the wall. Quick as thought, Miss
      Aldclyffe stood before the table, slipped her hand behind her, took one of
      the envelopes and put it in her pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sauntered round the rooms for two or three minutes longer, then
      withdrew and returned to her hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here she cut the Knapwater advertisement from the paper, put it into the
      envelope she had stolen, embossed with the society's stamp, and directed
      it in a round clerkly hand to the address she had seen in the list of
      members' names submitted to her:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     AENEAS MANSTON, ESQ.,
          WYKEHAM CHAMBERS,
               SPRING GARDENS.
</pre>
    <p>
      This ended her first day's work in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. FROM AUGUST THE TWENTY-SIXTH TO SEPTEMBER THE FIRST
    </p>
    <p>
      The two Cythereas continued at the Westminster Hotel, Miss Aldclyffe
      informing her companion that business would detain them in London another
      week. The days passed as slowly and quietly as days can pass in a city at
      that time of the year, the shuttered windows about the squares and
      terraces confronting their eyes like the white and sightless orbs of blind
      men. On Thursday Mr. Nyttleton called, bringing the whole number of
      replies to the advertisement. Cytherea was present at the interview, by
      Miss Aldclyffe's request&mdash;either from whim or design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten additional letters were the result of the second week's insertion,
      making fifty-five in all. Miss Aldclyffe looked them over as before. One
      was signed&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
AENEAS MANSTON,     133, TURNGATE STREET,
          LIVERPOOL.
</pre>
    <p>
      'Now, then, Mr. Nyttleton, will you make a selection, and I will add one
      or two,' Miss Aldclyffe said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Nyttleton scanned the whole heap of letters, testimonials, and
      references, sorting them into two heaps. Manston's missive, after a mere
      glance, was thrown amongst the summarily rejected ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe read, or pretended to read after the lawyer. When he had
      finished, five lay in the group he had selected. 'Would you like to add to
      the number?' he said, turning to the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' she said carelessly. 'Well, two or three additional ones rather took
      my fancy,' she added, searching for some in the larger collection.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew out three. One was Manston's.
    </p>
    <p>
      'These eight, then, shall be communicated with,' said the lawyer, taking
      up the eight letters and placing them by themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood up. 'If I myself, Miss Aldclyffe, were only concerned
      personally,' he said, in an off-hand way, and holding up a letter singly,
      'I should choose this man unhesitatingly. He writes honestly, is not
      afraid to name what he does not consider himself well acquainted with&mdash;a
      rare thing to find in answers to advertisements; he is well recommended,
      and possesses some qualities rarely found in combination. Oddly enough, he
      is not really a steward. He was bred a farmer, studied building affairs,
      served on an estate for some time, then went with an architect, and is now
      well qualified as architect, estate agent, and surveyor. That man is sure
      to have a fine head for a manor like yours.' He tapped the letter as he
      spoke. 'Yes, I should choose him without hesitation&mdash;speaking
      personally.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I think,' she said artificially, 'I should choose this one as a
      matter of mere personal whim, which, of course, can't be given way to when
      practical questions have to be considered.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea, after looking out of the window, and then at the newspapers, had
      become interested in the proceedings between the clever Miss Aldclyffe and
      the keen old lawyer, which reminded her of a game at cards. She looked
      inquiringly at the two letters&mdash;one in Miss Aldclyffe's hand, the
      other in Mr. Nyttleton's.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is the name of your man?' said Miss Aldclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      'His name&mdash;' said the lawyer, looking down the page; 'what is his
      name?&mdash;it is Edward Springrove.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe glanced towards Cytherea, who was getting red and pale by
      turns. She looked imploringly at Miss Aldclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The name of my man,' said Miss Aldclyffe, looking at her letter in turn;
      'is, I think&mdash;yes&mdash;AEneas Manston.'
    </p>
    <p>
      5. SEPTEMBER THE THIRD
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning but one was appointed for the interviews, which were to
      be at the lawyer's offices. Mr. Nyttleton and Mr. Tayling were both in
      town for the day, and the candidates were admitted one by one into a
      private room. In the window recess was seated Miss Aldclyffe, wearing her
      veil down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer had, in his letters to the selected number, timed each
      candidate at an interval of ten or fifteen minutes from those preceding
      and following. They were shown in as they arrived, and had short
      conversations with Mr. Nyttleton&mdash;terse, and to the point. Miss
      Aldclyffe neither moved nor spoke during this proceeding; it might have
      been supposed that she was quite unmindful of it, had it not been for what
      was revealed by a keen penetration of the veil covering her countenance&mdash;the
      rays from two bright black eyes, directed towards the lawyer and his
      interlocutor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Springrove came fifth; Manston seventh. When the examination of all was
      ended, and the last man had retired, Nyttleton, again as at the former
      time, blandly asked his client which of the eight she personally
      preferred. 'I still think the fifth we spoke to, Springrove, the man whose
      letter I pounced upon at first, to be by far the best qualified, in short,
      most suitable generally.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am sorry to say that I differ from you; I lean to my first notion still&mdash;that
      Mr.&mdash;Mr. Manston is most desirable in tone and bearing, and even
      specifically; I think he would suit me best in the long-run.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Nyttleton looked out of the window at the whitened wall of the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course, madam, your opinion may be perfectly sound and reliable; a
      sort of instinct, I know, often leads ladies by a short cut to conclusions
      truer than those come to by men after laborious round-about calculations,
      based on long experience. I must say I shouldn't recommend him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, pray?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, let us look first at his letter of answer to the advertisement. He
      didn't reply till the last insertion; that's one thing. His letter is bold
      and frank in tone, so bold and frank that the second thought after reading
      it is that not honesty, but unscrupulousness of conscience dictated it. It
      is written in an indifferent mood, as if he felt that he was humbugging us
      in his statement that he was the right man for such an office, that he
      tried hard to get it only as a matter of form which required that he
      should neglect no opportunity that came in his way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You may be right, Mr. Nyttleton, but I don't quite see the grounds of
      your reasoning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He has been, as you perceive, almost entirely used to the office duties
      of a city architect, the experience we don't want. You want a man whose
      acquaintance with rural landed properties is more practical and closer&mdash;somebody
      who, if he has not filled exactly such an office before, has lived a
      country life, knows the ins and outs of country tenancies, building,
      farming, and so on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's by far the most intellectual looking of them all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; he may be&mdash;your opinion, Miss Aldclyffe, is worth more than
      mine in that matter. And more than you say, he is a man of parts&mdash;his
      brain power would soon enable him to master details and fit him for the
      post, I don't much doubt that. But to speak clearly' (here his words
      started off at a jog-trot) 'I wouldn't run the risk of placing the
      management of an estate of mine in his hands on any account whatever.
      There, that's flat and plain, madam.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, definitely,' she said, with a show of impatience, 'what is your
      reason?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is a voluptuary with activity; which is a very bad form of man&mdash;as
      bad as it is rare.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh. Thank you for your explicit statement, Mr. Nyttleton,' said Miss
      Aldclyffe, starting a little and flushing with displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Nyttleton nodded slightly, as a sort of neutral motion, simply
      signifying a receipt of the information, good or bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I really think it is hardly worth while to trouble you further in
      this,' continued the lady. 'He's quite good enough for a little
      insignificant place like mine at Knapwater; and I know that I could not
      get on with one of the others for a single month. We'll try him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly, Miss Aldclyffe,' said the lawyer. And Mr. Manston was written
      to, to the effect that he was the successful competitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you see how unmistakably her temper was getting the better of her,
      that minute you were in the room?' said Nyttleton to Tayling, when their
      client had left the house. Nyttleton was a man who surveyed everybody's
      character in a sunless and shadowless northern light. A culpable slyness,
      which marked him as a boy, had been moulded by Time, the Improver, into
      honourable circumspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      We frequently find that the quality which, conjoined with the simplicity
      of the child, is vice, is virtue when it pervades the knowledge of the
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She was as near as damn-it to boiling over when I added up her man,'
      continued Nyttleton. 'His handsome face is his qualification in her eyes.
      They have met before; I saw that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He didn't seem conscious of it,' said the junior.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He didn't. That was rather puzzling to me. But still, if ever a woman's
      face spoke out plainly that she was in love with a man, hers did that she
      was with him. Poor old maid, she's almost old enough to be his mother. If
      that Manston's a schemer he'll marry her, as sure as I am Nyttleton. Let's
      hope he's honest, however.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't think she's in love with him,' said Tayling. He had seen but
      little of the pair, and yet he could not reconcile what he had noticed in
      Miss Aldclyffe's behaviour with the idea that it was the bearing of a
      woman towards her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, your experience of the fiery phenomenon is more recent than mine,'
      rejoined Nyttleton carelessly. 'And you may remember the nature of it
      best.'

    <h2>
      VIII. THE EVENTS OF EIGHTEEN DAYS
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1. FROM THE THIRD TO THE NINETEENTH OF SEPTEMBER
    </h3>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe's tenderness towards Cytherea, between the hours of her
      irascibility, increased till it became no less than doting fondness. Like
      Nature in the tropics, with her hurricanes and the subsequent luxuriant
      vegetation effacing their ravages, Miss Aldclyffe compensated for her
      outbursts by excess of generosity afterwards. She seemed to be completely
      won out of herself by close contact with a young woman whose modesty was
      absolutely unimpaired, and whose artlessness was as perfect as was
      compatible with the complexity necessary to produce the due charm of
      womanhood. Cytherea, on her part, perceived with honest satisfaction that
      her influence for good over Miss Aldclyffe was considerable. Ideas and
      habits peculiar to the younger, which the elder lady had originally
      imitated as a mere whim, she grew in course of time to take a positive
      delight in. Among others were evening and morning prayers, dreaming over
      out-door scenes, learning a verse from some poem whilst dressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet try to force her sympathies as much as she would, Cytherea could feel
      no more than thankful for this, even if she always felt as much as
      thankful. The mysterious cloud hanging over the past life of her
      companion, of which the uncertain light already thrown upon it only seemed
      to render still darker the unpenetrated remainder, nourished in her a
      feeling which was scarcely too slight to be called dread. She would have
      infinitely preferred to be treated distantly, as the mere dependent, by
      such a changeable nature&mdash;like a fountain, always herself, yet always
      another. That a crime of any deep dye had ever been perpetrated or
      participated in by her namesake, she would not believe; but the reckless
      adventuring of the lady's youth seemed connected with deeds of darkness
      rather than of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes Miss Aldclyffe appeared to be on the point of making some
      absorbing confidence, but reflection invariably restrained her. Cytherea
      hoped that such a confidence would come with time, and that she might thus
      be a means of soothing a mind which had obviously known extreme suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Aldclyffe's reticence concerning her past was not imitated by
      Cytherea. Though she never disclosed the one fact of her knowledge that
      the love-suit between Miss Aldclyffe and her father terminated abnormally,
      the maiden's natural ingenuousness on subjects not set down for special
      guard had enabled Miss Aldclyffe to worm from her, fragment by fragment,
      every detail of her father's history. Cytherea saw how deeply Miss
      Aldclyffe sympathized&mdash;and it compensated her, to some extent, for
      the hasty resentments of other times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus uncertainly she lived on. It was perceived by the servants of the
      House that some secret bond of connection existed between Miss Aldclyffe
      and her companion. But they were woman and woman, not woman and man, the
      facts were ethereal and refined, and so they could not be worked up into a
      taking story. Whether, as old critics disputed, a supernatural machinery
      be necessary to an epic or no, an ungodly machinery is decidedly necessary
      to a scandal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another letter had come to her from Edward&mdash;very short, but full of
      entreaty, asking why she would not write just one line&mdash;just one line
      of cold friendship at least? She then allowed herself to think, little by
      little, whether she had not perhaps been too harsh with him; and at last
      wondered if he were really much to blame for being engaged to another
      woman. 'Ah, Brain, there is one in me stronger than you!' she said. The
      young maid now continually pulled out his letter, read it and re-read it,
      almost crying with pity the while, to think what wretched suspense he must
      be enduring at her silence, till her heart chid her for her cruelty. She
      felt that she must send him a line&mdash;one little line&mdash;just a wee
      line to keep him alive, poor thing; sighing like Donna Clara&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'Ah, were he now before me,
        In spite of injured pride,
      I fear my eyes would pardon
        Before my tongue could chide.'
</pre>
    <p>
      2. SEPTEMBER THE TWENTIETH. THREE TO FOUR P.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the third week in September, about five weeks after Cytherea's
      arrival, when Miss Aldclyffe requested her one day to go through the
      village of Carriford and assist herself in collecting the subscriptions
      made by some of the inhabitants of the parish to a religious society she
      patronized. Miss Aldclyffe formed one of what was called a Ladies'
      Association, each member of which collected tributary streams of shillings
      from her inferiors, to add to her own pound at the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe took particular interest in Cytherea's appearance that
      afternoon, and the object of her attention was, indeed, gratifying to look
      at. The sight of the lithe girl, set off by an airy dress, coquettish
      jacket, flexible hat, a ray of starlight in each eye and a war of lilies
      and roses in each cheek, was a palpable pleasure to the mistress of the
      mansion, yet a pleasure which appeared to partake less of the nature of
      affectionate satisfaction than of mental gratification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight names were printed in the report as belonging to Miss Aldclyffe's
      list, with the amount of subscription-money attached to each.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will collect the first four, whilst you do the same with the last
      four,' said Miss Aldclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The names of two tradespeople stood first in Cytherea's share: then came a
      Miss Hinton: last of all in the printed list was Mr. Springrove the elder.
      Underneath his name was pencilled, in Miss Aldclyffe's handwriting, 'Mr.
      Manston.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston had arrived on the estate, in the capacity of steward, three or
      four days previously, and occupied the old manor-house, which had been
      altered and repaired for his reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Call on Mr. Manston,' said the lady impressively, looking at the name
      written under Cytherea's portion of the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But he does not subscribe yet?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know it; but call and leave him a report. Don't forget it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Say you would be pleased if he would subscribe?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes&mdash;say I should be pleased if he would,' repeated Miss Aldclyffe,
      smiling. 'Good-bye. Don't hurry in your walk. If you can't get easily
      through your task to-day put off some of it till to-morrow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Each then started on her rounds: Cytherea going in the first place to the
      old manor-house. Mr. Manston was not indoors, which was a relief to her.
      She called then on the two gentleman-farmers' wives, who soon transacted
      their business with her, frigidly indifferent to her personality. A person
      who socially is nothing is thought less of by people who are not much than
      by those who are a great deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      She then turned towards Peakhill Cottage, the residence of Miss Hinton,
      who lived there happily enough, with an elderly servant and a house-dog as
      companions. Her father, and last remaining parent, had retired thither
      four years before this time, after having filled the post of editor to the
      Casterbridge Chronicle for eighteen or twenty years. There he died soon
      after, and though comparatively a poor man, he left his daughter
      sufficiently well provided for as a modest fundholder and claimant of
      sundry small sums in dividends to maintain herself as mistress at
      Peakhill.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Cytherea's knock an inner door was heard to open and close, and
      footsteps crossed the passage hesitatingly. The next minute Cytherea stood
      face to face with the lady herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adelaide Hinton was about nine-and-twenty years of age. Her hair was
      plentiful, like Cytherea's own; her teeth equalled Cytherea's in
      regularity and whiteness. But she was much paler, and had features too
      transparent to be in place among household surroundings. Her mouth
      expressed love less forcibly than Cytherea's, and, as a natural result of
      her greater maturity, her tread was less elastic, and she was more
      self-possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been a girl of that kind which mothers praise as not forward, by
      way of contrast, when disparaging those warmer ones with whom loving is an
      end and not a means. Men of forty, too, said of her, 'a good sensible wife
      for any man, if she cares to marry,' the caring to marry being thrown in
      as the vaguest hypothesis, because she was so practical. Yet it would be
      singular if, in such cases, the important subject of marriage should be
      excluded from manipulation by hands that are ready for practical
      performance in every domestic concern besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea was an acquisition, and the greeting was hearty.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good afternoon! O yes&mdash;Miss Graye, from Miss Aldclyffe's. I have
      seen you at church, and I am so glad you have called! Come in. I wonder if
      I have change enough to pay my subscription.' She spoke girlishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adelaide, when in the company of a younger woman, always levelled herself
      down to that younger woman's age from a sense of justice to herself&mdash;as
      if, though not her own age at common law, it was in equity.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It doesn't matter. I'll come again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, do at any time; not only on this errand. But you must step in for a
      minute. Do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have been wanting to come for several weeks.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's right. Now you must see my house&mdash;lonely, isn't it, for a
      single person? People said it was odd for a young woman like me to keep on
      a house; but what did I care? If you knew the pleasure of locking up your
      own door, with the sensation that you reigned supreme inside it, you would
      say it was worth the risk of being called odd. Mr. Springrove attends to
      my gardening, the dog attends to robbers, and whenever there is a snake or
      toad to kill, Jane does it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How nice! It is better than living in a town.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Far better. A town makes a cynic of me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The remark recalled, somewhat startlingly, to Cytherea's mind, that Edward
      had used those very words to herself one evening at Budmouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hinton opened an interior door and led her visitor into a small
      drawing-room commanding a view of the country for miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The missionary business was soon settled; but the chat continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How lonely it must be here at night!' said Cytherea. 'Aren't you afraid?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'At first I was, slightly. But I got used to the solitude. And you know a
      sort of commonsense will creep even into timidity. I say to myself
      sometimes at night, "If I were anybody but a harmless woman, not worth the
      trouble of a worm's ghost to appear to me, I should think that every sound
      I hear was a spirit." But you must see all over my house.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea was highly interested in seeing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I say you <i>must</i> do this, and you <i>must</i> do that, as if you
      were a child,' remarked Adelaide. 'A privileged friend of mine tells me
      this use of the imperative comes of being so constantly in nobody's
      society but my own.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, yes. I suppose she is right.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea called the friend 'she' by a rule of ladylike practice; for a
      woman's 'friend' is delicately assumed by another friend to be of their
      own sex in the absence of knowledge to the contrary; just as cats are
      called she's until they prove themselves he's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hinton laughed mysteriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I get a humorous reproof for it now and then, I assure you,' she
      continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Humorous reproof:" that's not from a woman: who can reprove humorously
      but a man?' was the groove of Cytherea's thought at the remark. 'Your
      brother reproves you, I expect,' said that innocent young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' said Miss Hinton, with a candid air. ''Tis only a professional man I
      am acquainted with.' She looked out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Women are persistently imitative. No sooner did a thought flash through
      Cytherea's mind that the man was a lover than she became a Miss Aldclyffe
      in a mild form.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I imagine he's a lover,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hinton smiled a smile of experience in that line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few women, if taxed with having an admirer, are so free from vanity as to
      deny the impeachment, even if it is utterly untrue. When it does happen to
      be true, they look pityingly away from the person who is so benighted as
      to have got no further than suspecting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There now&mdash;Miss Hinton; you are engaged to be married!' said
      Cytherea accusingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adelaide nodded her head practically. 'Well, yes, I am,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word 'engaged' had no sooner passed Cytherea's lips than the sound of
      it&mdash;the mere sound of her own lips&mdash;carried her mind to the time
      and circumstances under which Miss Aldclyffe had used it towards herself.
      A sickening thought followed&mdash;based but on a mere surmise; yet its
      presence took every other idea away from Cytherea's mind. Miss Hinton had
      used Edward's words about towns; she mentioned Mr. Springrove as attending
      to her garden. It could not be that Edward was the man! that Miss
      Aldclyffe had planned to reveal her rival thus!
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are you going to be married soon?' she inquired, with a steadiness the
      result of a sort of fascination, but apparently of indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not very soon&mdash;still, soon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah-ha! In less than three months?' said Cytherea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Two.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that the subject was well in hand, Adelaide wanted no more prompting.
      'You won't tell anybody if I show you something?' she said, with eager
      mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no, nobody. But does he live in this parish?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing proved yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's his name?' said Cytherea flatly. Her breath and heart had begun
      their old tricks, and came and went hotly. Miss Hinton could not see her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do you think?' said Miss Hinton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'George?' said Cytherea, with deceitful agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' said Adelaide. 'But now, you shall see him first; come here;' and
      she led the way upstairs into her bedroom. There, standing on the dressing
      table in a little frame, was the unconscious portrait of Edward
      Springrove.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There he is,' Miss Hinton said, and a silence ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are you very fond of him?' continued the miserable Cytherea at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, of course I am,' her companion replied, but in the tone of one who
      'lived in Abraham's bosom all the year,' and was therefore untouched by
      solemn thought at the fact. 'He's my cousin&mdash;a native of this
      village. We were engaged before my father's death left me so lonely. I was
      only twenty, and a much greater belle than I am now. We know each other
      thoroughly, as you may imagine. I give him a little sermonizing now and
      then.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, it's only in fun. He's very naughty sometimes&mdash;not really, you
      know&mdash;but he will look at any pretty face when he sees it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Storing up this statement of his susceptibility as another item to be
      miserable upon when she had time, 'How do you know that?' Cytherea asked,
      with a swelling heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, you know how things do come to women's ears. He used to live at
      Budmouth as an assistant-architect, and I found out that a young giddy
      thing of a girl who lives there somewhere took his fancy for a day or two.
      But I don't feel jealous at all&mdash;our engagement is so matter-of-fact
      that neither of us can be jealous. And it was a mere flirtation&mdash;she
      was too silly for him. He's fond of rowing, and kindly gave her an airing
      for an evening or two. I'll warrant they talked the most unmitigated
      rubbish under the sun&mdash;all shallowness and pastime, just as
      everything is at watering places&mdash;neither of them caring a bit for
      the other&mdash;she giggling like a goose all the time&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      Concentrated essence of woman pervaded the room rather than air. 'She <i>didn't</i>!
      and it <i>wasn't</i> shallowness!' Cytherea burst out, with brimming eyes.
      ''Twas deep deceit on one side, and entire confidence on the other&mdash;yes,
      it was!' The pent-up emotion had swollen and swollen inside the young
      thing till the dam could no longer embay it. The instant the words were
      out she would have given worlds to have been able to recall them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you know her&mdash;or him?' said Miss Hinton, starting with suspicion
      at the warmth shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two rivals had now lost their personality quite. There was the same
      keen brightness of eye, the same movement of the mouth, the same mind in
      both, as they looked doubtingly and excitedly at each other. As is
      invariably the case with women when a man they care for is the subject of
      an excitement among them, the situation abstracted the differences which
      distinguished them as individuals, and left only the properties common to
      them as atoms of a sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea caught at the chance afforded her of not betraying herself. 'Yes,
      I know her,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' said Miss Hinton, 'I am really vexed if my speaking so lightly of
      any friend of yours has hurt your feelings, but&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, never mind,' Cytherea returned; 'it doesn't matter, Miss Hinton. I
      think I must leave you now. I have to call at other places. Yes&mdash;I
      must go.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hinton, in a perplexed state of mind, showed her visitor politely
      downstairs to the door. Here Cytherea bade her a hurried adieu, and
      flitted down the garden into the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      She persevered in her duties with a wayward pleasure in giving herself
      misery, as was her wont. Mr. Springrove's name was next on the list, and
      she turned towards his dwelling, the Three Tranters Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. FOUR TO FIVE P.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cottages along Carriford village street were not so close but that on
      one side or other of the road was always a hedge of hawthorn or privet,
      over or through which could be seen gardens or orchards rich with produce.
      It was about the middle of the early apple-harvest, and the laden trees
      were shaken at intervals by the gatherers; the soft pattering of the
      falling crop upon the grassy ground being diversified by the loud rattle
      of vagrant ones upon a rail, hencoop, basket, or lean-to roof, or upon the
      rounded and stooping backs of the collectors&mdash;mostly children, who
      would have cried bitterly at receiving such a smart blow from any other
      quarter, but smilingly assumed it to be but fun in apples.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Three Tranters Inn, a many-gabled, mediaeval building, constructed
      almost entirely of timber, plaster, and thatch, stood close to the line of
      the roadside, almost opposite the churchyard, and was connected with a row
      of cottages on the left by thatched outbuildings. It was an uncommonly
      characteristic and handsome specimen of the genuine roadside inn of bygone
      times; and standing on one of the great highways in this part of England,
      had in its time been the scene of as much of what is now looked upon as
      the romantic and genial experience of stage-coach travelling as any
      halting-place in the country. The railway had absorbed the whole stream of
      traffic which formerly flowed through the village and along by the ancient
      door of the inn, reducing the empty-handed landlord, who used only to farm
      a few fields at the back of the house, to the necessity of eking out his
      attenuated income by increasing the extent of his agricultural business if
      he would still maintain his social standing. Next to the general stillness
      pervading the spot, the long line of outbuildings adjoining the house was
      the most striking and saddening witness to the passed-away fortunes of the
      Three Tranters Inn. It was the bulk of the original stabling, and where
      once the hoofs of two-score horses had daily rattled over the stony yard,
      to and from the stalls within, thick grass now grew, whilst the line of
      roofs&mdash;once so straight&mdash;over the decayed stalls, had sunk into
      vast hollows till they seemed like the cheeks of toothless age.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a green plot at the other end of the building grew two or three large,
      wide-spreading elm-trees, from which the sign was suspended&mdash;representing
      the three men called tranters (irregular carriers), standing side by side,
      and exactly alike to a hair's-breadth, the grain of the wood and joints of
      the boards being visible through the thin paint depicting their forms,
      which were still further disfigured by red stains running downwards from
      the rusty nails above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the trees now stood a cider-mill and press, and upon the spot
      sheltered by the boughs were gathered Mr. Springrove himself, his men, the
      parish clerk, two or three other men, grinders and supernumeraries, a
      woman with an infant in her arms, a flock of pigeons, and some little boys
      with straws in their mouths, endeavouring, whenever the men's backs were
      turned, to get a sip of the sweet juice issuing from the vat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Springrove the elder, the landlord, now more particularly a farmer,
      and for two months in the year a cider-maker, was an employer of labour of
      the old school, who worked himself among his men. He was now engaged in
      packing the pomace into horsehair bags with a rammer, and Gad Weedy, his
      man, was occupied in shovelling up more from a tub at his side. The shovel
      shone like silver from the action of the juice, and ever and anon, in its
      motion to and fro, caught the rays of the declining sun and reflected them
      in bristling stars of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Springrove had been too young a man when the pristine days of the
      Three Tranters had departed for ever to have much of the host left in him
      now. He was a poet with a rough skin: one whose sturdiness was more the
      result of external circumstances than of intrinsic nature. Too kindly
      constituted to be very provident, he was yet not imprudent. He had a quiet
      humorousness of disposition, not out of keeping with a frequent
      melancholy, the general expression of his countenance being one of
      abstraction. Like Walt Whitman he felt as his years increased&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'I foresee too much; it means more than I thought.'
</pre>
    <p>
      On the present occasion he wore gaiters and a leathern apron, and worked
      with his shirt-sleeves rolled up beyond his elbows, disclosing solid and
      fleshy rather than muscular arms. They were stained by the cider, and two
      or three brown apple-pips from the pomace he was handling were to be seen
      sticking on them here and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other prominent figure was that of Richard Crickett, the parish clerk,
      a kind of Bowdlerized rake, who ate only as much as a woman, and had the
      rheumatism in his left hand. The remainder of the group, brown-faced
      peasants, wore smock-frocks embroidered on the shoulders with hearts and
      diamonds, and were girt round their middle with a strap, another being
      worn round the right wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And have you seen the steward, Mr. Springrove?' said the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just a glimpse of him; but 'twas just enough to show me that he's not
      here for long.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why mid that be?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He'll never stand the vagaries of the female figure holden the reins&mdash;not
      he.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She d' pay en well,' said a grinder; 'and money's money.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah&mdash;'tis: very much so,' the clerk replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes, naibour Crickett,' said Springrove, 'but she'll vlee in a
      passion&mdash;all the fat will be in the fire&mdash;and there's an end
      o't.... Yes, she is a one,' continued the farmer, resting, raising his
      eyes, and reading the features of a distant apple.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is,' said Gad, resting too (it is wonderful how prompt a journeyman
      is in following his master's initiative to rest) and reflectively
      regarding the ground in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'True: a one is she,' the clerk chimed in, shaking his head ominously.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She has such a temper,' said the farmer, 'and is so wilful too. You may
      as well try to stop a footpath as stop her when she has taken anything
      into her head. I'd as soon grind little green crabs all day as live wi'
      her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis a temper she hev, 'tis,' the clerk replied, 'though I be a servant
      of the Church that say it. But she isn't goen to flee in a passion this
      time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The audience waited for the continuation of the speech, as if they knew
      from experience the exact distance off it lay in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk swallowed nothing as if it were a great deal, and then went on,
      'There's some'at between 'em: mark my words, naibours&mdash;there's
      some'at between 'em.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'D'ye mean it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I d' know it. He came last Saturday, didn't he?'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''A did, truly,' said Gad Weedy, at the same time taking an apple from the
      hopper of the mill, eating a piece, and flinging back the remainder to be
      ground up for cider.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He went to church a-Sunday,' said the clerk again.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''A did.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And she kept her eye upon en all the service, her face flickeren between
      red and white, but never stoppen at either.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Springrove nodded, and went to the press.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' said the clerk, 'you don't call her the kind o' woman to make
      mistakes in just trotten through the weekly service o' God? Why, as a rule
      she's as right as I be myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Springrove nodded again, and gave a twist to the screw of the press,
      followed in the movement by Gad at the other side; the two grinders
      expressing by looks of the greatest concern that, if Miss Aldclyffe were
      as right at church as the clerk, she must be right indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, as right in the service o' God as I be myself,' repeated the clerk.
      'But last Sunday, when we were in the tenth commandment, says she,
      "Incline our hearts to keep this law," says she, when 'twas "Laws in our
      hearts, we beseech Thee," all the church through. Her eye was upon <i>him</i>&mdash;she
      was quite lost&mdash;"Hearts to keep this law," says she; she was no more
      than a mere shadder at that tenth time&mdash;a mere shadder. You mi't ha'
      mouthed across to her "Laws in our hearts we beseech Thee," fifty times
      over&mdash;she'd never ha' noticed ye. She's in love wi' the man, that's
      what she is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then she's a bigger stunpoll than I took her for,' said Mr. Springrove.
      'Why, she's old enough to be his mother.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The row'll be between her and that young Curlywig, you'll see. She won't
      run the risk of that pretty face be-en near.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Clerk Crickett, I d' fancy you d' know everything about everybody,' said
      Gad.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well so's,' said the clerk modestly. 'I do know a little. It comes to
      me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I d' know where from.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That wife o' thine. She's an entertainen woman, not to speak
      disrespectful.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is: and a winnen one. Look at the husbands she've had&mdash;God bless
      her!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wonder you could stand third in that list, Clerk Crickett,' said Mr.
      Springrove.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, 't has been a power o' marvel to myself oftentimes. Yes, matrimony
      do begin wi' "Dearly beloved," and ends wi' "Amazement," as the
      prayer-book says. But what could I do, naibour Springrove? 'Twas ordained
      to be. Well do I call to mind what your poor lady said to me when I had
      just married. "Ah, Mr. Crickett," says she, "your wife will soon settle
      you as she did her other two: here's a glass o' rum, for I shan't see your
      poor face this time next year." I swallered the rum, called again next
      year, and said, "Mrs. Springrove, you gave me a glass o' rum last year
      because I was going to die&mdash;here I be alive still, you see." "Well
      said, clerk! Here's two glasses for you now, then," says she. "Thank you,
      mem," I said, and swallered the rum. Well, dang my old sides, next year I
      thought I'd call again and get three. And call I did. But she wouldn't
      give me a drop o' the commonest. "No, clerk," says she, "you be too tough
      for a woman's pity."... Ah, poor soul, 'twas true enough! Here be I, that
      was expected to die, alive and hard as a nail, you see, and there's she
      moulderen in her grave.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I used to think 'twas your wife's fate not to have a liven husband when I
      zid 'em die off so,' said Gad.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Fate? Bless thy simplicity, so 'twas her fate; but she struggled to have
      one, and would, and did. Fate's nothen beside a woman's schemen!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose, then, that Fate is a He, like us, and the Lord, and the rest
      o' 'em up above there,' said Gad, lifting his eyes to the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hullo! Here's the young woman comen that we were a-talken about by-now,'
      said a grinder, suddenly interrupting. 'She's comen up here, as I be
      alive!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The two grinders stood and regarded Cytherea as if she had been a ship
      tacking into a harbour, nearly stopping the mill in their new interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Stylish accoutrements about the head and shoulders, to my thinken,' said
      the clerk. 'Sheenen curls, and plenty o' em.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If there's one kind of pride more excusable than another in a young
      woman, 'tis being proud of her hair,' said Mr. Springrove.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear man!&mdash;the pride there is only a small piece o' the whole. I
      warrant now, though she can show such a figure, she ha'n't a stick o'
      furniture to call her own.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come, Clerk Crickett, let the maid be a maid while she is a maid,' said
      Farmer Springrove chivalrously.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O,' replied the servant of the Church; 'I've nothen to say against it&mdash;O
      no:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     '"The chimney-sweeper's daughter Sue
         As I have heard declare, O,
       Although she's neither sock nor shoe
         Will curl and deck her hair, O."'
</pre>
    <p>
      Cytherea was rather disconcerted at finding that the gradual cessation of
      the chopping of the mill was on her account, and still more when she saw
      all the cider-makers' eyes fixed upon her except Mr. Springrove's, whose
      natural delicacy restrained him. She neared the plot of grass, but instead
      of advancing further, hesitated on its border.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Springrove perceived her embarrassment, which was relieved when she
      saw his old-established figure coming across to her, wiping his hands in
      his apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know your errand, missie,' he said, 'and am glad to see you, and attend
      to it. I'll step indoors.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you are busy I am in no hurry for a minute or two,' said Cytherea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then if so be you really wouldn't mind, we'll wring down this last
      filling to let it drain all night?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not at all. I like to see you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We are only just grinding down the early pickthongs and griffins,'
      continued the farmer, in a half-apologetic tone for detaining by his
      cider-making any well-dressed woman. 'They rot as black as a chimney-crook
      if we keep 'em till the regulars turn in.' As he spoke he went back to the
      press, Cytherea keeping at his elbow. 'I'm later than I should have been
      by rights,' he continued, taking up a lever for propelling the screw, and
      beckoning to the men to come forward. 'The truth is, my son Edward had
      promised to come to-day, and I made preparations; but instead of him comes
      a letter: "London, September the eighteenth, Dear Father," says he, and
      went on to tell me he couldn't. It threw me out a bit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course,' said Cytherea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's got a place 'a b'lieve?' said the clerk, drawing near.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, poor mortal fellow, no. He tried for this one here, you know, but
      couldn't manage to get it. I don't know the rights o' the matter, but
      willy-nilly they wouldn't have him for steward. Now mates, form in line.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Springrove, the clerk, the grinders, and Gad, all ranged themselves behind
      the lever of the screw, and walked round like soldiers wheeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The man that the old quean hev got is a man you can hardly get upon your
      tongue to gainsay, by the look o' en,' rejoined Clerk Crickett.
    </p>
    <p>
      'One o' them people that can contrive to be thought no worse o' for
      stealen a horse than another man for looken over hedge at en,' said a
      grinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, he's all there as steward, and is quite the gentleman&mdash;no
      doubt about that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So would my Ted ha' been, for the matter o' that,' the farmer said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's true: 'a would, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I said, I'll give Ted a good education if it do cost me my eyes, and I
      would have done it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, that you would so,' said the chorus of assistants solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But he took to books and drawing naturally, and cost very little; and as
      a wind-up the womenfolk hatched up a match between him and his cousin.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'When's the wedden to be, Mr. Springrove?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Uncertain&mdash;but soon, I suppose. Edward, you see, can do anything
      pretty nearly, and yet can't get a straightforward living. I wish
      sometimes I had kept him here, and let professions go. But he was such a
      one for the pencil.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He dropped the lever in the hedge, and turned to his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now then, missie, if you'll come indoors, please.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Gad Weedy looked with a placid criticism at Cytherea as she withdrew with
      the farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I could tell by the tongue o' her that she didn't take her degrees in our
      county,' he said in an undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The railways have left you lonely here,' she observed, when they were
      indoors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Save the withered old flies, which were quite tame from the solitude, not
      a being was in the house. Nobody seemed to have entered it since the last
      passenger had been called out to mount the last stage-coach that had run
      by.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, the Inn and I seem almost a pair of fossils,' the farmer replied,
      looking at the room and then at himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, Mr. Springrove,' said Cytherea, suddenly recollecting herself; 'I am
      much obliged to you for recommending me to Miss Aldclyffe.' She began to
      warm towards the old man; there was in him a gentleness of disposition
      which reminded her of her own father.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Recommending? Not at all, miss. Ted&mdash;that's my son&mdash;Ted said a
      fellow-draughtsman of his had a sister who wanted to be doing something in
      the world, and I mentioned it to the housekeeper, that's all. Ay, I miss
      my son very much.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She kept her back to the window that he might not see her rising colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' he continued, 'sometimes I can't help feeling uneasy about him. You
      know, he seems not made for a town life exactly: he gets very queer over
      it sometimes, I think. Perhaps he'll be better when he's married to
      Adelaide.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A half-impatient feeling arose in her, like that which possesses a sick
      person when he hears a recently-struck hour struck again by a slow clock.
      She had lived further on.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Everything depends upon whether he loves her,' she said tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He used to&mdash;he doesn't show it so much now; but that's because he's
      older. You see, it was several years ago they first walked together as
      young man and young woman. She's altered too from what she was when he
      first courted her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, she's more sensible by half. When he used to write to her she'd creep
      up the lane and look back over her shoulder, and slide out the letter, and
      read a word and stand in thought looking at the hills and seeing none.
      Then the cuckoo would cry&mdash;away the letter would slip, and she'd
      start wi' fright at the mere bird, and have a red skin before the quickest
      man among ye could say, "Blood rush up."'
    </p>
    <p>
      He came forward with the money and dropped it into her hand. His thoughts
      were still with Edward, and he absently took her little fingers in his as
      he said, earnestly and ingenuously&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis so seldom I get a gentlewoman to speak to that I can't help speaking
      to you, Miss Graye, on my fears for Edward; I sometimes am afraid that
      he'll never get on&mdash;that he'll die poor and despised under the worst
      mental conditions, a keen sense of having been passed in the race by men
      whose brains are nothing to his own, all through his seeing too far into
      things&mdash;being discontented with make-shifts&mdash;thinking o'
      perfection in things, and then sickened that there's no such thing as
      perfection. I shan't be sorry to see him marry, since it may settle him
      down and do him good.... Ay, we'll hope for the best.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He let go her hand and accompanied her to the door saying, 'If you should
      care to walk this way and talk to an old man once now and then, it will be
      a great delight to him, Miss Graye. Good-evening to ye.... Ah look! a
      thunderstorm is brewing&mdash;be quick home. Or shall I step up with you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, thank you, Mr. Springrove. Good evening,' she said in a low voice,
      and hurried away. One thought still possessed her; Edward had trifled with
      her love.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. FIVE TO SIX P.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      She followed the road into a bower of trees, overhanging it so densely
      that the pass appeared like a rabbit's burrow, and presently reached a
      side entrance to the park. The clouds rose more rapidly than the farmer
      had anticipated: the sheep moved in a trail, and complained incoherently.
      Livid grey shades, like those of the modern French painters, made a
      mystery of the remote and dark parts of the vista, and seemed to insist
      upon a suspension of breath. Before she was half-way across the park the
      thunder rumbled distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The direction in which she had to go would take her close by the old
      manor-house. The air was perfectly still, and between each low rumble of
      the thunder behind she could hear the roar of the waterfall before her,
      and the creak of the engine among the bushes hard by it. Hurrying on, with
      a growing dread of the gloom and of the approaching storm, she drew near
      the Old House, now rising before her against the dark foliage and sky in
      tones of strange whiteness.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the flight of steps, which descended from a terrace in front to the
      level of the park, stood a man. He appeared, partly from the relief the
      position gave to his figure, and partly from fact, to be of towering
      height. He was dark in outline, and was looking at the sky, with his hands
      behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was necessary for Cytherea to pass directly across the line of his
      front. She felt so reluctant to do this, that she was about to turn under
      the trees out of the path and enter it again at a point beyond the Old
      House; but he had seen her, and she came on mechanically, unconsciously
      averting her face a little, and dropping her glance to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes unswervingly lingered along the path until they fell upon another
      path branching in a right line from the path she was pursuing. It came
      from the steps of the Old House. 'I am exactly opposite him now,' she
      thought, 'and his eyes are going through me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A clear masculine voice said, at the same instant&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are you afraid?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She, interpreting his question by her feelings at the moment, assumed
      himself to be the object of fear, if any. 'I don't think I am,' she
      stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to know that she thought in that sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of the thunder, I mean,' he said; 'not of myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She must turn to him now. 'I think it is going to rain,' she remarked for
      the sake of saying something.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not conceal his surprise and admiration of her face and bearing.
      He said courteously, 'It may possibly not rain before you reach the House,
      if you are going there?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I am,'
    </p>
    <p>
      'May I walk up with you? It is lonely under the trees.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No.' Fearing his courtesy arose from a belief that he was addressing a
      woman of higher station than was hers, she added, 'I am Miss Aldclyffe's
      companion. I don't mind the loneliness.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, Miss Aldclyffe's companion. Then will you be kind enough to take a
      subscription to her? She sent to me this afternoon to ask me to become a
      subscriber to her Society, and I was out. Of course I'll subscribe if she
      wishes it. I take a great interest in the Society.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Aldclyffe will be glad to hear that, I know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; let me see&mdash;what Society did she say it was? I am afraid I
      haven't enough money in my pocket, and yet it would be a satisfaction to
      her to have practical proof of my willingness. I'll get it, and be out in
      one minute.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered the house and was at her side again within the time he had
      named. 'This is it,' he said pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held up her hand. The soft tips of his fingers brushed the palm of her
      glove as he placed the money within it. She wondered why his fingers
      should have touched her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think after all,' he continued, 'that the rain is upon us, and will
      drench you before you reach the House. Yes: see there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to a round wet spot as large as a nasturtium leaf, which had
      suddenly appeared upon the white surface of the step.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You had better come into the porch. It is not nearly night yet. The
      clouds make it seem later than it really is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Heavy drops of rain, followed immediately by a forked flash of lightning
      and sharp rattling thunder compelled her, willingly or no, to accept his
      invitation. She ascended the steps, stood beside him just within the
      porch, and for the first time obtained a series of short views of his
      person, as they waited there in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an extremely handsome man, well-formed, and well-dressed, of an age
      which seemed to be two or three years less than thirty. The most striking
      point in his appearance was the wonderful, almost preternatural, clearness
      of his complexion. There was not a blemish or speck of any kind to mar the
      smoothness of its surface or the beauty of its hue. Next, his forehead was
      square and broad, his brows straight and firm, his eyes penetrating and
      clear. By collecting the round of expressions they gave forth, a person
      who theorized on such matters would have imbibed the notion that their
      owner was of a nature to kick against the pricks; the last man in the
      world to put up with a position because it seemed to be his destiny to do
      so; one who took upon himself to resist fate with the vindictive
      determination of a Theomachist. Eyes and forehead both would have
      expressed keenness of intellect too severely to be pleasing, had their
      force not been counteracted by the lines and tone of the lips. These were
      full and luscious to a surprising degree, possessing a woman-like softness
      of curve, and a ruby redness so intense, as to testify strongly to much
      susceptibility of heart where feminine beauty was concerned&mdash;a
      susceptibility that might require all the ballast of brain with which he
      had previously been credited to confine within reasonable channels.
    </p>
    <p>
      His manner was rather elegant than good: his speech well-finished and
      unconstrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pause in their discourse, which had been caused by the peal of thunder
      was unbroken by either for a minute or two, during which the ears of both
      seemed to be absently following the low roar of the waterfall as it became
      gradually rivalled by the increasing rush of rain upon the trees and
      herbage of the grove. After her short looks at him, Cytherea had turned
      her head towards the avenue for a while, and now, glancing back again for
      an instant, she discovered that his eyes were engaged in a steady, though
      delicate, regard of her face and form.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, by reason of the narrowness of the porch, their dresses
      touched, and remained in contact.
    </p>
    <p>
      His clothes are something exterior to every man; but to a woman her dress
      is part of her body. Its motions are all present to her intelligence if
      not to her eyes; no man knows how his coat-tails swing. By the slightest
      hyperbole it may be said that her dress has sensation. Crease but the very
      Ultima Thule of fringe or flounce, and it hurts her as much as pinching
      her. Delicate antennae, or feelers, bristle on every outlying frill. Go to
      the uppermost: she is there; tread on the lowest: the fair creature is
      there almost before you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the touch of clothes, which was nothing to Manston, sent a thrill
      through Cytherea, seeing, moreover, that he was of the nature of a
      mysterious stranger. She looked out again at the storm, but still felt
      him. At last to escape the sensation she moved away, though by so doing it
      was necessary to advance a little into the rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look, the rain is coming into the porch upon you,' he said. 'Step inside
      the door.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perfectly safe, I assure you,' he added, laughing, and holding the door
      open. 'You shall see what a state of disorganization I am in&mdash;boxes
      on boxes, furniture, straw, crockery, in every form of transposition. An
      old woman is in the back quarters somewhere, beginning to put things to
      rights.... You know the inside of the house, I dare say?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have never been in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O well, come along. Here, you see, they have made a door through, here,
      they have put a partition dividing the old hall into two, one part is now
      my parlour; there they have put a plaster ceiling, hiding the old
      chestnut-carved roof because it was too high and would have been chilly
      for me; you see, being the original hall, it was open right up to the top,
      and here the lord of the manor and his retainers used to meet and be merry
      by the light from the monstrous fire which shone out from that monstrous
      fire-place, now narrowed to a mere nothing for my grate, though you can
      see the old outline still. I almost wish I could have had it in its
      original state.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'With more romance and less comfort.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, exactly. Well, perhaps the wish is not deep-seated. You will see how
      the things are tumbled in anyhow, packing-cases and all. The only piece of
      ornamental furniture yet unpacked is this one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'An organ?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, an organ. I made it myself, except the pipes. I opened the case this
      afternoon to commence soothing myself at once. It is not a very large one,
      but quite big enough for a private house. You play, I dare say?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The piano. I am not at all used to an organ.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You would soon acquire the touch for an organ, though it would spoil your
      touch for the piano. Not that that matters a great deal. A piano isn't
      much as an instrument.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is the fashion to say so now. I think it is quite good enough.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That isn't altogether a right sentiment about things being good enough.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No&mdash;no. What I mean is, that the men who despise pianos do it as a
      rule from their teeth, merely for fashion's sake, because cleverer men
      have said it before them&mdash;not from the experience of their ears.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Cytherea all at once broke into a blush at the consciousness of a
      great snub she had been guilty of in her eagerness to explain herself. He
      charitably expressed by a look that he did not in the least mind her
      blunder, if it were one; and this attitude forced him into a position of
      mental superiority which vexed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I play for my private amusement only,' he said. 'I have never learned
      scientifically. All I know is what I taught myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The thunder, lightning, and rain had now increased to a terrific force.
      The clouds, from which darts, forks, zigzags, and balls of fire
      continually sprang, did not appear to be more than a hundred yards above
      their heads, and every now and then a flash and a peal made gaps in the
      steward's descriptions. He went towards the organ, in the midst of a
      volley which seemed to shake the aged house from foundations to chimney.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are not going to play now, are you?' said Cytherea uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes. Why not now?' he said. 'You can't go home, and therefore we may as
      well be amused, if you don't mind sitting on this box. The few chairs I
      have unpacked are in the other room.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Without waiting to see whether she sat down or not, he turned to the organ
      and began extemporizing a harmony which meandered through every variety of
      expression of which the instrument was capable. Presently he ceased and
      began searching for some music-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a splendid flash!' he said, as the lightning again shone in through
      the mullioned window, which, of a proportion to suit the whole extent of
      the original hall, was much too large for the present room. The thunder
      pealed again. Cytherea, in spite of herself, was frightened, not only at
      the weather, but at the general unearthly weirdness which seemed to
      surround her there.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wish I&mdash;the lightning wasn't so bright. Do you think it will last
      long?' she said timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It can't last much longer,' he murmured, without turning, running his
      fingers again over the keys. 'But this is nothing,' he continued, suddenly
      stopping and regarding her. 'It seems brighter because of the deep shadow
      under those trees yonder. Don't mind it; now look at me&mdash;look in my
      face&mdash;now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He had faced the window, looking fixedly at the sky with his dark strong
      eyes. She seemed compelled to do as she was bidden, and looked in the
      too-delicately beautiful face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flash came; but he did not turn or blink, keeping his eyes fixed as
      firmly as before. 'There,' he said, turning to her, 'that's the way to
      look at lightning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, it might have blinded you!' she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nonsense&mdash;not lightning of this sort&mdash;I shouldn't have stared
      at it if there had been danger. It is only sheet-lightning now. Now, will
      you have another piece? Something from an oratorio this time?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, thank you&mdash;I don't want to hear it whilst it thunders so.' But
      he had begun without heeding her answer, and she stood motionless again,
      marvelling at the wonderful indifference to all external circumstance
      which was now evinced by his complete absorption in the music before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why do you play such saddening chords?' she said, when he next paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      'H'm&mdash;because I like them, I suppose,' said he lightly. 'Don't you
      like sad impressions sometimes?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sometimes, perhaps.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'When you are full of trouble.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, why shouldn't I when I am full of trouble?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are you troubled?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am troubled.' He said this thoughtfully and abruptly&mdash;so abruptly
      that she did not push the dialogue further.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now played more powerfully. Cytherea had never heard music in the
      completeness of full orchestral power, and the tones of the organ, which
      reverberated with considerable effect in the comparatively small space of
      the room, heightened by the elemental strife of light and sound outside,
      moved her to a degree out of proportion to the actual power of the mere
      notes, practised as was the hand that produced them. The varying strains&mdash;now
      loud, now soft; simple, complicated, weird, touching, grand, boisterous,
      subdued; each phase distinct, yet modulating into the next with a graceful
      and easy flow&mdash;shook and bent her to themselves, as a gushing brook
      shakes and bends a shadow cast across its surface. The power of the music
      did not show itself so much by attracting her attention to the subject of
      the piece, as by taking up and developing as its libretto the poem of her
      own life and soul, shifting her deeds and intentions from the hands of her
      judgment and holding them in its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was swayed into emotional opinions concerning the strange man before
      her; new impulses of thought came with new harmonies, and entered into her
      with a gnawing thrill. A dreadful flash of lightning then, and the thunder
      close upon it. She found herself involuntarily shrinking up beside him,
      and looking with parted lips at his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned his eyes and saw her emotion, which greatly increased the ideal
      element in her expressive face. She was in the state in which woman's
      instinct to conceal has lost its power over her impulse to tell; and he
      saw it. Bending his handsome face over her till his lips almost touched
      her ear, he murmured, without breaking the harmonies&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you very much like this piece?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very much indeed,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I could see you were affected by it. I will copy it for you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you much.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will bring it to the House to you to-morrow. Who shall I ask for?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, not for me. Don't bring it,' she said hastily. 'I shouldn't like you
      to.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let me see&mdash;to-morrow evening at seven or a few minutes past I shall
      be passing the waterfall on my way home. I could conveniently give it you
      there, and I should like you to have it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He modulated into the Pastoral Symphony, still looking in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well,' she said, to get rid of the look.
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm had by this time considerably decreased in violence, and in
      seven or ten minutes the sky partially cleared, the clouds around the
      western horizon becoming lighted up with the rays of the sinking sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea drew a long breath of relief, and prepared to go away. She was
      full of a distressing sense that her detention in the old manor-house, and
      the acquaintanceship it had set on foot, was not a thing she wished. It
      was such a foolish thing to have been excited and dragged into frankness
      by the wiles of a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Allow me to come with you,' he said, accompanying her to the door, and
      again showing by his behaviour how much he was impressed with her. His
      influence over her had vanished with the musical chords, and she turned
      her back upon him. 'May I come?' he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no. The distance is not a quarter of a mile&mdash;it is really not
      necessary, thank you,' she said quietly. And wishing him good-evening,
      without meeting his eyes, she went down the steps, leaving him standing at
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, how is it that man has so fascinated me?' was all she could think. Her
      own self, as she had sat spell-bound before him, was all she could see.
      Her gait was constrained, from the knowledge that his eyes were upon her
      until she had passed the hollow by the waterfall, and by ascending the
      rise had become hidden from his view by the boughs of the overhanging
      trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. SIX TO SEVEN P.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wet shining road threw the western glare into her eyes with an
      invidious lustre which rendered the restlessness of her mood more
      wearying. Her thoughts flew from idea to idea without asking for the
      slightest link of connection between one and another. One moment she was
      full of the wild music and stirring scene with Manston&mdash;-the next,
      Edward's image rose before her like a shadowy ghost. Then Manston's black
      eyes seemed piercing her again, and the reckless voluptuous mouth appeared
      bending to the curves of his special words. What could be those troubles
      to which he had alluded? Perhaps Miss Aldclyffe was at the bottom of them.
      Sad at heart she paced on: her life was bewildering her.
    </p>
    <p>
      On coming into Miss Aldclyffe's presence Cytherea told her of the
      incident, not without a fear that she would burst into one of her
      ungovernable fits of temper at learning Cytherea's slight departure from
      the programme. But, strangely to Cytherea, Miss Aldclyffe looked
      delighted. The usual cross-examination followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And so you were with him all that time?' said the lady, with assumed
      severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I was.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did not tell you to call at the Old House twice.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I didn't call, as I have said. He made me come into the porch.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What remarks did he make, do you say?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That the lightning was not so bad as I thought.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A very important remark, that. Did he&mdash;' she turned her glance full
      upon the girl, and eyeing her searchingly, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did he say anything about <i>me</i>?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing,' said Cytherea, returning her gaze calmly, 'except that I was to
      give you the subscription.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are quite sure?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I believe you. Did he say anything striking or strange about himself?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Only one thing&mdash;that he was troubled,'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Troubled!'
    </p>
    <p>
      After saying the word, Miss Aldclyffe relapsed into silence. Such
      behaviour as this had ended, on most previous occasions, by her making a
      confession, and Cytherea expected one now. But for once she was mistaken,
      nothing more was said.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had returned to her room she sat down and penned a farewell
      letter to Edward Springrove, as little able as any other excitable and
      brimming young woman of nineteen to feel that the wisest and only
      dignified course at that juncture was to do nothing at all. She told him
      that, to her painful surprise, she had learnt that his engagement to
      another woman was a matter of notoriety. She insisted that all honour bade
      him marry his early love&mdash;a woman far better than her unworthy self,
      who only deserved to be forgotten, and begged him to remember that he was
      not to see her face again. She upbraided him for levity and cruelty in
      meeting her so frequently at Budmouth, and above all in stealing the kiss
      from her lips on the last evening of the water excursions. 'I never, never
      can forget it!' she said, and then felt a sensation of having done her
      duty, ostensibly persuading herself that her reproaches and commands were
      of such a force that no man to whom they were uttered could ever approach
      her more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it was all unconsciously said in words which betrayed a lingering
      tenderness of love at every unguarded turn. Like Beatrice accusing Dante
      from the chariot, try as she might to play the superior being who
      contemned such mere eye-sensuousness, she betrayed at every point a pretty
      woman's jealousy of a rival, and covertly gave her old lover hints for
      excusing himself at each fresh indictment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This done, Cytherea, still in a practical mood, upbraided herself with
      weakness in allowing a stranger like Mr. Manston to influence her as he
      had done that evening. What right on earth had he to suggest so suddenly
      that she might meet him at the waterfall to receive his music? She would
      have given much to be able to annihilate the ascendency he had obtained
      over her during that extraordinary interval of melodious sound. Not being
      able to endure the notion of his living a minute longer in the belief he
      was then holding, she took her pen and wrote to him also:&mdash;
    </p>

      A great statesman thinks several times, and acts; a young lady acts, and
      thinks several times. When, a few minutes later, she saw the postman carry
      off the bag containing one of the letters, and a messenger with the other,
      she, for the first time, asked herself the question whether she had acted
      very wisely in writing to either of the two men who had so influenced her.

      IX. THE EVENTS OF TEN WEEKS
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1. FROM SEPTEMBER THE TWENTY-FIRST TO THE MIDDLE OF NOVEMBER
    </h3>
    <p>
      The foremost figure within Cytherea's horizon, exclusive of the inmates of
      Knapwater House, was now the steward, Mr. Manston. It was impossible that
      they should live within a quarter of a mile of each other, be engaged in
      the same service, and attend the same church, without meeting at some spot
      or another, twice or thrice a week. On Sundays, in her pew, when by chance
      she turned her head, Cytherea found his eyes waiting desirously for a
      glimpse of hers, and, at first more strangely, the eyes of Miss Aldclyffe
      furtively resting on him. On coming out of church he frequently walked
      beside Cytherea till she reached the gate at which residents in the House
      turned into the shrubbery. By degrees a conjecture grew to a certainty.
      She knew that he loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a strange fact was connected with the development of his love. He was
      palpably making the strongest efforts to subdue, or at least to hide, the
      weakness, and as it sometimes seemed, rather from his own conscience than
      from surrounding eyes. Hence she found that not one of his encounters with
      her was anything more than the result of pure accident. He made no
      advances whatever: without avoiding her, he never sought her: the words he
      had whispered at their first interview now proved themselves to be quite
      as much the result of unguarded impulse as was her answer. Something held
      him back, bound his impulse down, but she saw that it was neither pride of
      his person, nor fear that she would refuse him&mdash;a course she
      unhesitatingly resolved to take should he think fit to declare himself.
      She was interested in him and his marvellous beauty, as she might have
      been in some fascinating panther or leopard&mdash;for some undefinable
      reason she shrank from him, even whilst she admired. The keynote of her
      nature, a warm 'precipitance of soul,' as Coleridge happily writes it,
      which Manston had so directly pounced upon at their very first interview,
      gave her now a tremulous sense of being in some way in his power.
    </p>
    <p>
      The state of mind was, on the whole, a dangerous one for a young and
      inexperienced woman; and perhaps the circumstance which, more than any
      other, led her to cherish Edward's image now, was that he had taken no
      notice of the receipt of her letter, stating that she discarded him. It
      was plain then, she said, that he did not care deeply for her, and she
      thereupon could not quite leave off caring deeply for him:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                  'Ingenium mulierum,
              Nolunt ubi velis, ubi nolis cupiunt ultro.'
</pre>
    <p>
      The month of October passed, and November began its course. The
      inhabitants of the village of Carriford grew weary of supposing that Miss
      Aldclyffe was going to marry her steward. New whispers arose and became
      very distinct (though they did not reach Miss Aldclyffe's ears) to the
      effect that the steward was deeply in love with Cytherea Graye. Indeed,
      the fact became so obvious that there was nothing left to say about it
      except that their marriage would be an excellent one for both;&mdash;for
      her in point of comfort&mdash;and for him in point of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      As circles in a pond grow wider and wider, the next fact, which at first
      had been patent only to Cytherea herself, in due time spread to her
      neighbours, and they, too, wondered that he made no overt advances. By the
      middle of November, a theory made up of a combination of the other two was
      received with general favour: its substance being that a guilty intrigue
      had been commenced between Manston and Miss Aldclyffe, some years before,
      when he was a very young man, and she still in the enjoyment of some
      womanly beauty, but now that her seniority began to grow emphatic she was
      becoming distasteful to him. His fear of the effect of the lady's jealousy
      would, they said, thus lead him to conceal from her his new attachment to
      Cytherea. Almost the only woman who did not believe this was Cytherea
      herself, on unmistakable grounds, which were hidden from all besides. It
      was not only in public, but even more markedly in secluded places, on
      occasions when gallantry would have been safe from all discovery, that
      this guarded course of action was pursued, all the strength of a consuming
      passion burning in his eyes the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. NOVEMBER THE EIGHTEENTH
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on a Friday in this month of November that Owen Graye paid a visit
      to his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      His zealous integrity still retained for him the situation at Budmouth,
      and in order that there should be as little interruption as possible to
      his duties there, he had decided not to come to Knapwater till late in the
      afternoon, and to return to Budmouth by the first train the next morning,
      Miss Aldclyffe having made a point of frequently offering him lodging for
      an unlimited period, to the great pleasure of Cytherea.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached the house about four o'clock, and ringing the bell, asked of
      the page who answered it for Miss Graye.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Graye spoke the name of his sister, Manston, who was just coming out
      from an interview with Miss Aldclyffe, passed him in the vestibule and
      heard the question. The steward's face grew hot, and he secretly clenched
      his hands. He half crossed the court, then turned his head and saw that
      the lad still stood at the door, though Owen had been shown into the
      house. Manston went back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who was that man?' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Has he ever been here before?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How many times?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Three.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are sure you don't know him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think he is Miss Graye's brother, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then, why the devil didn't you say so before!' Manston exclaimed, and
      again went on his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course, that was not the man of my dreams&mdash;of course, it couldn't
      be!' he said to himself. 'That I should be such a fool&mdash;such an utter
      fool. Good God! to allow a girl to influence me like this, day after day,
      till I am jealous of her very brother. A lady's dependent, a waif, a
      helpless thing entirely at the mercy of the world; yes, curse it; that is
      just why it is; that fact of her being so helpless against the blows of
      circumstances which renders her so deliciously sweet!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused opposite his house. Should he get his horse saddled? No.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went down the drive and out of the park, having started to proceed to
      an outlying spot on the estate concerning some draining, and to call at
      the potter's yard to make an arrangement for the supply of pipes. But a
      remark which Miss Aldclyffe had dropped in relation to Cytherea was what
      still occupied his mind, and had been the immediate cause of his
      excitement at the sight of her brother. Miss Aldclyffe had meaningly
      remarked during their intercourse, that Cytherea was wildly in love with
      Edward Springrove, in spite of his engagement to his cousin Adelaide.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How I am harassed!' he said aloud, after deep thought for half-an-hour,
      while still continuing his walk with the greatest vehemence. 'How I am
      harassed by these emotions of mine!' He calmed himself by an effort.
      'Well, duty after all it shall be, as nearly as I can effect it. "Honesty
      is the best policy;"' with which vigorously uttered resolve he once more
      attempted to turn his attention to the prosy object of his journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening had closed in to a dark and dreary night when the steward came
      from the potter's door to proceed homewards again. The gloom did not tend
      to raise his spirits, and in the total lack of objects to attract his eye,
      he soon fell to introspection as before. It was along the margin of turnip
      fields that his path lay, and the large leaves of the crop struck flatly
      against his feet at every step, pouring upon them the rolling drops of
      moisture gathered upon their broad surfaces; but the annoyance was
      unheeded. Next reaching a fir plantation, he mounted the stile and
      followed the path into the midst of the darkness produced by the
      overhanging trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      After walking under the dense shade of the inky boughs for a few minutes,
      he fancied he had mistaken the path, which as yet was scarcely familiar to
      him. This was proved directly afterwards by his coming at right angles
      upon some obstruction, which careful feeling with outstretched hands soon
      told him to be a rail fence. However, as the wood was not large, he
      experienced no alarm about finding the path again, and with some sense of
      pleasure halted awhile against the rails, to listen to the intensely
      melancholy yet musical wail of the fir-tops, and as the wind passed on,
      the prompt moan of an adjacent plantation in reply. He could just dimly
      discern the airy summits of the two or three trees nearest him waving
      restlessly backwards and forwards, and stretching out their boughs like
      hairy arms into the dull sky. The scene, from its striking and emphatic
      loneliness, began to grow congenial to his mood; all of human kind seemed
      at the antipodes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden rattle on his right hand caused him to start from his reverie,
      and turn in that direction. There, before him, he saw rise up from among
      the trees a fountain of sparks and smoke, then a red glare of light coming
      forward towards him; then a flashing panorama of illuminated oblong
      pictures; then the old darkness, more impressive than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surprise, which had owed its origin to his imperfect acquaintance with
      the topographical features of that end of the estate, had been but
      momentary; the disturbance, a well-known one to dwellers by a railway,
      being caused by the 6.50 down-train passing along a shallow cutting in the
      midst of the wood immediately below where he stood, the driver having the
      fire-door of the engine open at the minute of going by. The train had,
      when passing him, already considerably slackened speed, and now a whistle
      was heard, announcing that Carriford Road Station was not far in its van.
    </p>
    <p>
      But contrary to the natural order of things, the discovery that it was
      only a commonplace train had not caused Manston to stir from his position
      of facing the railway.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the 6.50 down-train had been a flash of forked lightning transfixing
      him to the earth, he could scarcely have remained in a more trance-like
      state. He still leant against the railings, his right hand still continued
      pressing on his walking-stick, his weight on one foot, his other heel
      raised, his eyes wide open towards the blackness of the cutting. The only
      movement in him was a slight dropping of the lower jaw, separating his
      previously closed lips a little way, as when a strange conviction rushes
      home suddenly upon a man. A new surprise, not nearly so trivial as the
      first, had taken possession of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on this account. At one of the illuminated windows of a
      second-class carriage in the series gone by, he had seen a pale face,
      reclining upon one hand, the light from the lamp falling full upon it. The
      face was a woman's.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Manston moved; gave a whispering kind of whistle, adjusted his
      hat, and walked on again, cross-questioning himself in every direction as
      to how a piece of knowledge he had carefully concealed had found its way
      to another person's intelligence. 'How can my address have become known?'
      he said at length, audibly. 'Well, it is a blessing I have been
      circumspect and honourable, in relation to that&mdash;yes, I will say it,
      for once, even if the words choke me, that darling of mine, Cytherea,
      never to be my own, never. I suppose all will come out now. All!' The
      great sadness of his utterance proved that no mean force had been
      exercised upon himself to sustain the circumspection he had just claimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wheeled to the left, pursued the ditch beside the railway fence, and
      presently emerged from the wood, stepping into a road which crossed the
      railway by a bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he neared home, the anxiety lately written in his face, merged by
      degrees into a grimly humorous smile, which hung long upon his lips, and
      he quoted aloud a line from the book of Jeremiah&mdash;
    </p>

      3. NOVEMBER THE NINETEENTH. DAYBREAK
    </p>
    <p>
      Before it was light the next morning, two little naked feet pattered along
      the passage in Knapwater House, from which Owen Graye's bedroom opened,
      and a tap was given upon his door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Owen, Owen, are you awake?' said Cytherea in a whisper through the
      keyhole. 'You must get up directly, or you'll miss the train.'
    </p>
    <p>
      When he descended to his sister's little room, he found her there already
      waiting with a cup of cocoa and a grilled rasher on the table for him. A
      hasty meal was despatched in the intervals of putting on his overcoat and
      finding his hat, and they then went softly through the long deserted
      passages, the kitchen-maid who had prepared their breakfast walking before
      them with a lamp held high above her head, which cast long wheeling
      shadows down corridors intersecting the one they followed, their remoter
      ends being lost in darkness. The door was unbolted and they stepped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen had preferred walking to the station to accepting the pony-carriage
      which Miss Aldclyffe had placed at his disposal, having a morbid horror of
      giving trouble to people richer than himself, and especially to their
      men-servants, who looked down upon him as a hybrid monster in social
      position. Cytherea proposed to walk a little way with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I want to talk to you as long as I can,' she said tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother and sister then emerged by the heavy door into the drive. The
      feeling and aspect of the hour were precisely similar to those under which
      the steward had left the house the evening previous, excepting that
      apparently unearthly reversal of natural sequence, which is caused by the
      world getting lighter instead of darker. 'The tearful glimmer of the
      languid dawn' was just sufficient to reveal to them the melancholy red
      leaves, lying thickly in the channels by the roadside, ever and anon
      loudly tapped on by heavy drops of water, which the boughs above had
      collected from the foggy air.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed the Old House, engaged in a deep conversation, and had
      proceeded about twenty yards by a cross route, in the direction of the
      turnpike road, when the form of a woman emerged from the porch of the
      building.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was wrapped in a grey waterproof cloak, the hood of which was drawn
      over her head and closely round her face&mdash;so closely that her eyes
      were the sole features uncovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this one exception of her appearance there, the most perfect
      stillness and silence pervaded the steward's residence from basement to
      chimney. Not a shutter was open; not a twine of smoke came forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Underneath the ivy-covered gateway she stood still and listened for two,
      or possibly three minutes, till she became conscious of others in the
      park. Seeing the pair she stepped back, with the apparent intention of
      letting them pass out of sight, and evidently wishing to avoid
      observation. But looking at her watch, and returning it rapidly to her
      pocket, as if surprised at the lateness of the hour, she hurried out
      again, and across the park by a still more oblique line than that traced
      by Owen and his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      These in the meantime had got into the road, and were walking along it as
      the woman came up on the other side of the boundary hedge, looking for a
      gate or stile, by which she, too, might get off the grass upon the hard
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their conversation, of which every word was clear and distinct, in the
      still air of the dawn, to the distance of a quarter of a mile, reached her
      ears, and withdrew her attention from all other matters and sights
      whatsoever. Thus arrested she stood for an instant as precisely in the
      attitude of Imogen by the cave of Belarius, as if she had studied the
      position from the play. When they had advanced a few steps, she followed
      them in some doubt, still screened by the hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you believe in such odd coincidences?' said Cytherea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How do you mean, believe in them? They occur sometimes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, one will occur often enough&mdash;that is, two disconnected events
      will fall strangely together by chance, and people scarcely notice the
      fact beyond saying, "Oddly enough it happened that so and so were the
      same," and so on. But when three such events coincide without any apparent
      reason for the coincidence, it seems as if there must be invisible means
      at work. You see, three things falling together in that manner are ten
      times as singular as two cases of coincidence which are distinct.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, of course: what a mathematical head you have, Cytherea! But I don't
      see so much to marvel at in our case. That the man who kept the
      public-house in which Miss Aldclyffe fainted, and who found out her name
      and position, lives in this neighbourhood, is accounted for by the fact
      that she got him the berth to stop his tongue. That you came here was
      simply owing to Springrove.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, but look at this. Miss Aldclyffe is the woman our father first loved,
      and I have come to Miss Aldclyffe's; you can't get over that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      From these premises, she proceeded to argue like an elderly divine on the
      designs of Providence which were apparent in such conjunctures, and went
      into a variety of details connected with Miss Aldclyffe's history.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Had I better tell Miss Aldclyffe that I know all this?' she inquired at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's the use?' he said. 'Your possessing the knowledge does no harm;
      you are at any rate comfortable here, and a confession to Miss Aldclyffe
      might only irritate her. No, hold your tongue, Cytherea.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I fancy I should have been tempted to tell her too,' Cytherea went on,
      'had I not found out that there exists a very odd, almost imperceptible,
      and yet real connection of some kind between her and Mr. Manston, which is
      more than that of a mutual interest in the estate.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is in love with him!' exclaimed Owen; 'fancy that!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah&mdash;that's what everybody says who has been keen enough to notice
      anything. I said so at first. And yet now I cannot persuade myself that
      she is in love with him at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why can't you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She doesn't act as if she were. She isn't&mdash;you will know I don't say
      it from any vanity, Owen&mdash;she isn't the least jealous of me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps she is in some way in his power.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No&mdash;she is not. He was openly advertised for, and chosen from forty
      or fifty who answered the advertisement, without knowing whose it was. And
      since he has been here, she has certainly done nothing to compromise
      herself in any way. Besides, why should she have brought an enemy here at
      all?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then she must have fallen in love with him. You know as well as I do,
      Cyth, that with women there's nothing between the two poles of emotion
      towards an interesting male acquaintance. 'Tis either love or aversion.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked for a few minutes in silence, when Cytherea's eyes
      accidentally fell upon her brother's feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Owen,' she said, 'do you know that there is something unusual in your
      manner of walking?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is it like?' he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't quite say, except that you don't walk so regularly as you used
      to.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman behind the hedge, who had still continued to dog their
      footsteps, made an impatient movement at this change in their
      conversation, and looked at her watch again. Yet she seemed reluctant to
      give over listening to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' Owen returned with assumed carelessness, 'I do know it. I think the
      cause of it is that mysterious pain which comes just above my ankle
      sometimes. You remember the first time I had it? That day we went by
      steam-packet to Lulstead Cove, when it hindered me from coming back to
      you, and compelled me to sleep with the gateman we have been talking
      about.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But is it anything serious, dear Owen?' Cytherea exclaimed, with some
      alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, nothing at all. It is sure to go off again. I never find a sign of it
      when I sit in the office.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Again their unperceived companion made a gesture of vexation, and looked
      at her watch as if time were precious. But the dialogue still flowed on
      upon this new subject, and showed no sign of returning to its old channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gathering up her skirt decisively she renounced all further hope, and
      hurried along the ditch till she had dropped into a valley, and came to a
      gate which was beyond the view of those coming behind. This she softly
      opened, and came out upon the road, following it in the direction of the
      railway station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she heard Owen Graye's footsteps in her rear, his quickened pace
      implying that he had parted from his sister. The woman thereupon increased
      her rapid walk to a run, and in a few minutes safely distanced her
      fellow-traveller.
    </p>
    <p>
      The railway at Carriford Road consisted only of a single line of rails;
      and the short local down-train by which Owen was going to Budmouth was
      shunted on to a siding whilst the first up-train passed. Graye entered the
      waiting-room, and the door being open he listlessly observed the movements
      of a woman wearing a long grey cloak, and closely hooded, who had asked
      for a ticket for London.
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed her with his eyes on to the platform, saw her waiting there
      and afterwards stepping into the train: his recollection of her ceasing
      with the perception.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. EIGHT TO TEN O'CLOCK A.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crickett, twice a widow, and now the parish clerk's wife, a
      fine-framed, scandal-loving woman, with a peculiar corner to her eye by
      which, without turning her head, she could see what people were doing
      almost behind her, lived in a cottage standing nearer to the old
      manor-house than any other in the village of Carriford, and she had on
      that account been temporarily engaged by the steward, as a respectable
      kind of charwoman and general servant, until a settled arrangement could
      be made with some person as permanent domestic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every morning, therefore, Mrs. Crickett, immediately she had lighted the
      fire in her own cottage, and prepared the breakfast for herself and
      husband, paced her way to the Old House to do the same for Mr. Manston.
      Then she went home to breakfast; and when the steward had eaten his, and
      had gone out on his rounds, she returned again to clear away, make his
      bed, and put the house in order for the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of Owen Graye's departure, she went through the operations
      of her first visit as usual&mdash;proceeded home to breakfast, and went
      back again, to perform those of the second.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering Manston's empty bedroom, with her hands on her hips, she
      indifferently cast her eyes upon the bed, previously to dismantling it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst she looked, she thought in an inattentive manner, 'What a
      remarkably quiet sleeper Mr. Manston must be!' The upper bed-clothes were
      flung back, certainly, but the bed was scarcely disarranged. 'Anybody
      would almost fancy,' she thought, 'that he had made it himself after
      rising.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But these evanescent thoughts vanished as they had come, and Mrs. Crickett
      set to work; she dragged off the counterpane, blankets and sheets, and
      stooped to lift the pillows. Thus stooping, something arrested her
      attention; she looked closely&mdash;more closely&mdash;very closely.
      'Well, to be sure!' was all she could say. The clerk's wife stood as if
      the air had suddenly set to amber, and held her fixed like a fly in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The object of her wonder was a trailing brown hair, very little less than
      a yard long, which proved it clearly to be a hair from some woman's head.
      She drew it off the pillow, and took it to the window; there holding it
      out she looked fixedly at it, and became utterly lost in meditation: her
      gaze, which had at first actively settled on the hair, involuntarily
      dropped past its object by degrees and was lost on the floor, as the inner
      vision obscured the outer one.
    </p>
    <p>
      She at length moistened her lips, returned her eyes to the hair, wound it
      round her fingers, put it in some paper, and secreted the whole in her
      pocket. Mrs. Crickett's thoughts were with her work no more that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      She searched the house from roof-tree to cellar, for some other trace of
      feminine existence or appurtenance; but none was to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went out into the yard, coal-hole, stable, hay-loft, green-house,
      fowl-house, and piggery, and still there was no sign. Coming in again, she
      saw a bonnet, eagerly pounced upon it; and found it to be her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hastily completing her arrangements in the other rooms, she entered the
      village again, and called at once on the postmistress, Elizabeth Leat, an
      intimate friend of hers, and a female who sported several unique diseases
      and afflictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crickett unfolded the paper, took out the hair, and waved it on high
      before the perplexed eyes of Elizabeth, which immediately mooned and
      wandered after it like a cat's.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is it?' said Mrs. Leat, contracting her eyelids, and stretching out
      towards the invisible object a narrow bony hand that would have been an
      unmitigated delight to the pencil of Carlo Crivelli.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You shall hear,' said Mrs. Crickett, complacently gathering up the
      treasure into her own fat hand; and the secret was then solemnly imparted,
      together with the accident of its discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shaving-glass was taken down from a nail, laid on its back in the middle
      of a table by the window, and the hair spread carefully out upon it. The
      pair then bent over the table from opposite sides, their elbows on the
      edge, their hands supporting their heads, their foreheads nearly touching,
      and their eyes upon the hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He ha' been mad a'ter my lady Cytherea,' said Mrs. Crickett, 'and 'tis my
      very belief the hair is&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No 'tidn'. Hers idn' so dark as that,' said Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Elizabeth, you know that as the faithful wife of a servant of the Church,
      I should be glad to think as you do about the girl. Mind I don't wish to
      say anything against Miss Graye, but this I do say, that I believe her to
      be a nameless thing, and she's no right to stick a moral clock in her
      face, and deceive the country in such a way. If she wasn't of a bad stock
      at the outset she was bad in the planten, and if she wasn't bad in the
      planten, she was bad in the growen, and if not in the growen, she's made
      bad by what she's gone through since.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I have another reason for knowing it idn' hers,' said Mrs. Leat.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah! I know whose it is then&mdash;Miss Aldclyffe's, upon my song!'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis the colour of hers, but I don't believe it to be hers either.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't you believe what they d' say about her and him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I say nothen about that; but you don't know what I know about his
      letters.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What about 'em?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He d' post all his letters here except those for one person, and they he
      d' take to Budmouth. My son is in Budmouth Post Office, as you know, and
      as he d' sit at desk he can see over the blind of the window all the
      people who d' post letters. Mr. Manston d' unvariably go there wi' letters
      for that person; my boy d' know 'em by sight well enough now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is it a she?'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis a she.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's her name?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The little stunpoll of a fellow couldn't call to mind more than that 'tis
      Miss Somebody, of London. However, that's the woman who ha' been here,
      depend upon't&mdash;a wicked one&mdash;some poor street-wench escaped from
      Sodom, I warrant ye.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Only to find herself in Gomorrah, seemingly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That may be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no, Mrs. Leat, this is clear to me. 'Tis no miss who came here to see
      our steward last night&mdash;whenever she came or wherever she vanished.
      Do you think he would ha' let a miss get here how she could, go away how
      she would, without breakfast or help of any kind?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth shook her head&mdash;Mrs. Crickett looked at her solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I say I know she had no help of any kind; I know it was so, for the grate
      was quite cold when I touched it this morning with these fingers, and he
      was still in bed. No, he wouldn't take the trouble to write letters to a
      girl and then treat her so off-hand as that. There's a tie between 'em
      stronger than feelen. She's his wife.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He married! The Lord so 's, what shall we hear next? Do he look married
      now? His are not the abashed eyes and lips of a married man.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps she's a tame one&mdash;but she's his wife still.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no: he's not a married man.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes, he is. I've had three, and I ought to know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, well,' said Mrs. Leat, giving way. 'Whatever may be the truth on't
      I trust Providence will settle it all for the best, as He always do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, ay, Elizabeth,' rejoined Mrs. Crickett with a satirical sigh, as she
      turned on her foot to go home, 'good people like you may say so, but I
      have always found Providence a different sort of feller.'
    </p>
    <p>
      5. NOVEMBER THE TWENTIETH
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Miss Aldclyffe's custom, a custom originated by her father, and
      nourished by her own exclusiveness, to unlock the post-bag herself every
      morning, instead of allowing the duty to devolve on the butler, as was the
      case in most of the neighbouring county families. The bag was brought
      upstairs each morning to her dressing-room, where she took out the
      contents, mostly in the presence of her maid and Cytherea, who had the
      entree of the chamber at all hours, and attended there in the morning at a
      kind of reception on a small scale, which was held by Miss Aldclyffe of
      her namesake only.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here she read her letters before the glass, whilst undergoing the
      operation of being brushed and dressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What woman can this be, I wonder?' she said on the morning succeeding
      that of the last section. '"London, N.!" It is the first time in my life I
      ever had a letter from that outlandish place, the North side of London.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea had just come into her presence to learn if there was anything
      for herself; and on being thus addressed, walked up to Miss Aldclyffe's
      corner of the room to look at the curiosity which had raised such an
      exclamation. But the lady, having opened the envelope and read a few
      lines, put it quickly in her pocket, before Cytherea could reach her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, 'tis nothing,' she said. She proceeded to make general remarks in a
      noticeably forced tone of sang-froid, from which she soon lapsed into
      silence. Not another word was said about the letter: she seemed very
      anxious to get her dressing done, and the room cleared. Thereupon Cytherea
      went away to the other window, and a few minutes later left the room to
      follow her own pursuits.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late when Miss Aldclyffe descended to the breakfast-table and then
      she seemed there to no purpose; tea, coffee, eggs, cutlets, and all their
      accessories, were left absolutely untasted. The next that was seen of her
      was when walking up and down the south terrace, and round the flower-beds;
      her face was pale, and her tread was fitful, and she crumpled a letter in
      her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner-time came round as usual; she did not speak ten words, or indeed
      seem conscious of the meal; for all that Miss Aldclyffe did in the way of
      eating, dinner might have been taken out as intact as it was taken in.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her own private apartment Miss Aldclyffe again pulled out the letter of
      the morning. One passage in it ran thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course, being his wife, I could publish the fact, and compel him to
      acknowledge me at any moment, notwithstanding his threats, and reasonings
      that it will be better to wait. I have waited, and waited again, and the
      time for such acknowledgment seems no nearer than at first. To show you
      how patiently I have waited I can tell you that not till a fortnight ago,
      when by stress of circumstances I had been driven to new lodgings, have I
      ever assumed my married name, solely on account of its having been his
      request all along that I should not do it. This writing to you, madam, is
      my first disobedience, and I am justified in it. A woman who is driven to
      visit her husband like a thief in the night and then sent away like a
      street dog&mdash;left to get up, unbolt, unbar, and find her way out of
      the house as she best may&mdash;is justified in doing anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But should I demand of him a restitution of rights, there would be
      involved a publicity which I could not endure, and a noisy scandal
      flinging my name the length and breadth of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What I still prefer to any such violent means is that you reason with him
      privately, and compel him to bring me home to your parish in a decent and
      careful manner, in the way that would be adopted by any respectable man,
      whose wife had been living away from him for some time, by reason, say, of
      peculiar family circumstances which had caused disunion, but not enmity,
      and who at length was enabled to reinstate her in his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You will, I know, oblige me in this, especially as knowledge of a
      peculiar transaction of your own, which took place some years ago, has
      lately come to me in a singular way. I will not at present trouble you by
      describing how. It is enough, that I alone, of all people living, know <i>all
      the sides of the story</i>, those from whom I collected it having each
      only a partial knowledge which confuses them and points to nothing. One
      person knows of your early engagement and its sudden termination; another,
      of the reason of those strange meetings at inns and coffee-houses;
      another, of what was sufficient to cause all this, and so on. I know what
      fits one and all the circumstances like a key, and shows them to be the
      natural outcrop of a rational (though rather rash) line of conduct for a
      young lady. You will at once perceive how it was that some at least of
      these things were revealed to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This knowledge then, common to, and secretly treasured by us both, is the
      ground upon which I beg for your friendship and help, with a feeling that
      you will be too generous to refuse it to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I may add that, as yet, my husband knows nothing of this, neither need he
      if you remember my request.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A threat&mdash;a flat stinging threat! as delicately wrapped up in words
      as the woman could do it; a threat from a miserable unknown creature to an
      Aldclyffe, and not the least proud member of the family either! A threat
      on his account&mdash;O, O! shall it be?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently this humour of defiance vanished, and the members of her body
      became supple again, her proceedings proving that it was absolutely
      necessary to give way, Aldclyffe as she was. She wrote a short answer to
      Mrs. Manston, saying civilly that Mr. Manston's possession of such a near
      relation was a fact quite new to herself, and that she would see what
      could be done in such an unfortunate affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. NOVEMBER THE TWENTY-FIRST
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston received a message the next day requesting his attendance at the
      House punctually at eight o'clock the ensuing evening. Miss Aldclyffe was
      brave and imperious, but with the purpose she had in view she could not
      look him in the face whilst daylight shone upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steward was shown into the library. On entering it, he was immediately
      struck with the unusual gloom which pervaded the apartment. The fire was
      dead and dull, one lamp, and that a comparatively small one, was burning
      at the extreme end, leaving the main proportion of the lofty and sombre
      room in an artificial twilight, scarcely powerful enough to render visible
      the titles of the folio and quarto volumes which were jammed into the
      lower tiers of the bookshelves.
    </p>
    <p>
      After keeping him waiting for more than twenty minutes (Miss Aldclyffe
      knew that excellent recipe for taking the stiffness out of human flesh,
      and for extracting all pre-arrangement from human speech) she entered the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston sought her eye directly. The hue of her features was not
      discernible, but the calm glance she flung at him, from which all attempt
      at returning his scrutiny was absent, awoke him to the perception that
      probably his secret was by some means or other known to her; how it had
      become known he could not tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew forth the letter, unfolded it, and held it up to him, letting it
      hang by one corner from between her finger and thumb, so that the light
      from the lamp, though remote, fell directly upon its surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You know whose writing this is?' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the strokes plainly, instantly resolving to burn his ships and
      hazard all on an advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My wife's,' he said calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His quiet answer threw her off her balance. She had no more expected an
      answer than does a preacher when he exclaims from the pulpit, 'Do you feel
      your sin?' She had clearly expected a sudden alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And why all this concealment?' she said again, her voice rising, as she
      vainly endeavoured to control her feelings, whatever they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It doesn't follow that, because a man is married, he must tell every
      stranger of it, madam,' he answered, just as calmly as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Stranger! well, perhaps not; but, Mr. Manston, why did you choose to
      conceal it, I ask again? I have a perfect right to ask this question, as
      you will perceive, if you consider the terms of my advertisement.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will tell you. There were two simple reasons. The first was this
      practical one; you advertised for an unmarried man, if you remember?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course I remember.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, an incident suggested to me that I should try for the situation. I
      was married; but, knowing that in getting an office where there is a
      restriction of this kind, leaving one's wife behind is always accepted as
      a fulfilment of the condition, I left her behind for awhile. The other
      reason is, that these terms of yours afforded me a plausible excuse for
      escaping (for a short time) the company of a woman I had been mistaken in
      marrying.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mistaken! what was she?' the lady inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A third-rate actress, whom I met with during my stay in Liverpool last
      summer, where I had gone to fulfil a short engagement with an architect.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where did she come from?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is an American by birth, and I grew to dislike her when we had been
      married a week.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She was ugly, I imagine?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is not an ugly woman by any means.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Up to the ordinary standard?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite up to the ordinary standard&mdash;indeed, handsome. After a while
      we quarrelled and separated.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You did not ill-use her, of course?' said Miss Aldclyffe, with a little
      sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did not.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But at any rate, you got thoroughly tired of her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston looked as if he began to think her questions out of place;
      however, he said quietly, 'I did get tired of her. I never told her so,
      but we separated; I to come here, bringing her with me as far as London
      and leaving her there in perfectly comfortable quarters; and though your
      advertisement expressed a single man, I have always intended to tell you
      the whole truth; and this was when I was going to tell it, when your
      satisfaction with my careful management of your affairs should have proved
      the risk to be a safe one to run.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I saw that you were good enough to be interested in my welfare to a
      greater extent than I could have anticipated or hoped, judging you by the
      frigidity of other employers, and this caused me to hesitate. I was vexed
      at the complication of affairs. So matters stood till three nights ago; I
      was then walking home from the pottery, and came up to the railway. The
      down-train came along close to me, and there, sitting at a carriage
      window, I saw my wife: she had found out my address, and had thereupon
      determined to follow me here. I had not been home many minutes before she
      came in, next morning early she left again&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because you treated her so cavalierly?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And as I suppose, wrote to you directly. That's the whole story of her,
      madam.' Whatever were Manston's real feelings towards the lady who had
      received his explanation in these supercilious tones, they remained locked
      within him as within a casket of steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did your friends know of your marriage, Mr. Manston?' she continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nobody at all; we kept it a secret for various reasons.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is true then that, as your wife tells me in this letter, she has not
      passed as Mrs. Manston till within these last few days?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is quite true; I was in receipt of a very small and uncertain income
      when we married; and so she continued playing at the theatre as before our
      marriage, and in her maiden name.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Has she any friends?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have never heard that she has any in England. She came over here on
      some theatrical speculation, as one of a company who were going to do
      much, but who never did anything; and here she has remained.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A pause ensued, which was terminated by Miss Aldclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I understand,' she said. 'Now, though I have no direct right to concern
      myself with your private affairs (beyond those which arise from your
      misleading me and getting the office you hold)&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'As to that, madam,' he interrupted, rather hotly, 'as to coming here, I
      am vexed as much as you. Somebody, a member of the Institute of Architects&mdash;who,
      I could never tell&mdash;sent to my old address in London your
      advertisement cut from the paper; it was forwarded to me; I wanted to get
      away from Liverpool, and it seemed as if this was put in my way on
      purpose, by some old friend or other. I answered the advertisement
      certainly, but I was not particularly anxious to come here, nor am I
      anxious to stay.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe descended from haughty superiority to womanly persuasion
      with a haste which was almost ludicrous. Indeed, the Quos ego of the whole
      lecture had been less the genuine menace of the imperious ruler of
      Knapwater than an artificial utterance to hide a failing heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, now, Mr. Manston, you wrong me; don't suppose I wish to be
      overbearing, or anything of the kind; and you will allow me to say this
      much, at any rate, that I have become interested in your wife, as well as
      in yourself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly, madam,' he said, slowly, like a man feeling his way in the
      dark. Manston was utterly at fault now. His previous experience of the
      effect of his form and features upon womankind en masse, had taught him to
      flatter himself that he could account by the same law of natural selection
      for the extraordinary interest Miss Aldclyffe had hitherto taken in him,
      as an unmarried man; an interest he did not at all object to, seeing that
      it kept him near Cytherea, and enabled him, a man of no wealth, to rule on
      the estate as if he were its lawful owner. Like Curius at his Sabine farm,
      he had counted it his glory not to possess gold himself, but to have power
      over her who did. But at this hint of the lady's wish to take his wife
      under her wing also, he was perplexed: could she have any sinister motive
      in doing so? But he did not allow himself to be troubled with these
      doubts, which only concerned his wife's happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She tells me,' continued Miss Aldclyffe, 'how utterly alone in the world
      she stands, and that is an additional reason why I should sympathize with
      her. Instead, then, of requesting the favour of your retirement from the
      post, and dismissing your interests altogether, I will retain you as my
      steward still, on condition that you bring home your wife, and live with
      her respectably, in short, as if you loved her; you understand. I <i>wish</i>
      you to stay here if you grant that everything shall flow smoothly between
      yourself and her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The breast and shoulders of the steward rose, as if an expression of
      defiance was about to be poured forth; before it took form, he controlled
      himself and said, in his natural voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'My part of the performance shall be carried out, madam.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And her anxiety to obtain a standing in the world ensures that hers
      will,' replied Miss Aldclyffe. 'That will be satisfactory, then.'
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few additional remarks, she gently signified that she wished to
      put an end to the interview. The steward took the hint and retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt vexed and mortified; yet in walking homeward he was convinced that
      telling the whole truth as he had done, with the single exception of his
      love for Cytherea (which he tried to hide even from himself), had never
      served him in better stead than it had done that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston went to his desk and thought of Cytherea's beauty with the
      bitterest, wildest regret. After the lapse of a few minutes he calmed
      himself by a stoical effort, and wrote the subjoined letter to his wife:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                        'KNAPWATER,
                                         November 21, 1864.
</pre>
    <p>
      'DEAR EUNICE,&mdash;I hope you reached London safely after your flighty
      visit to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      'As I promised, I have thought over our conversation that night, and your
      wish that your coming here should be no longer delayed. After all, it was
      perfectly natural that you should have spoken unkindly as you did,
      ignorant as you were of the circumstances which bound me.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So I have made arrangements to fetch you home at once. It is hardly worth
      while for you to attempt to bring with you any luggage you may have
      gathered about you (beyond mere clothing). Dispose of superfluous things
      at a broker's; your bringing them would only make a talk in this parish,
      and lead people to believe we had long been keeping house separately.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will next Monday suit you for coming? You have nothing to do that can
      occupy you for more than a day or two, as far as I can see, and the
      remainder of this week will afford ample time. I can be in London the
      night before, and we will come down together by the mid-day train&mdash;Your
      very affectionate husband,

    <p>
      'Now, of course, I shall no longer write to you as Mrs. Rondley.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The address on the envelope was&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
MRS. MANSTON,   41 CHARLES SQUARE,
     HOXTON,
        LONDON, N.
</pre>
    <p>
      He took the letter to the house, and it being too late for the country
      post, sent one of the stablemen with it to Casterbridge, instead of
      troubling to go to Budmouth with it himself as heretofore. He had no
      longer any necessity to keep his condition a secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. FROM THE TWENTY-SECOND TO THE TWENTY-SEVENTH OF NOVEMBER
    </p>
    <p>
      But the next morning Manston found that he had been forgetful of another
      matter, in naming the following Monday to his wife for the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact was this. A letter had just come, reminding him that he had left
      the whole of the succeeding week open for an important business engagement
      with a neighbouring land-agent, at that gentleman's residence thirteen
      miles off. The particular day he had suggested to his wife, had, in the
      interim, been appropriated by his correspondent. The meeting could not now
      be put off.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he wrote again to his wife, stating that business, which could not be
      postponed, called him away from home on Monday, and would entirely prevent
      him coming all the way to fetch her on Sunday night as he had intended,
      but that he would meet her at the Carriford Road Station with a conveyance
      when she arrived there in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day came his wife's answer to his first letter, in which she said
      that she would be ready to be fetched at the time named. Having already
      written his second letter, which was by that time in her hands, he made no
      further reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The week passed away. The steward had, in the meantime, let it become
      generally known in the village that he was a married man, and by a little
      judicious management, sound family reasons for his past secrecy upon the
      subject, which were floated as adjuncts to the story, were placidly
      received; they seemed so natural and justifiable to the unsophisticated
      minds of nine-tenths of his neighbours, that curiosity in the matter,
      beyond a strong curiosity to see the lady's face, was well-nigh
      extinguished.

      X. THE EVENTS OF A DAY AND NIGHT
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1. NOVEMBER THE TWENTY-EIGHTH. UNTIL TEN P.M.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Monday came, the day named for Mrs. Manston's journey from London to her
      husband's house; a day of singular and great events, influencing the
      present and future of nearly all the personages whose actions in a complex
      drama form the subject of this record.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proceedings of the steward demand the first notice. Whilst taking his
      breakfast on this particular morning, the clock pointing to eight, the
      horse-and-gig that was to take him to Chettlewood waiting ready at the
      door, Manston hurriedly cast his eyes down the column of Bradshaw which
      showed the details and duration of the selected train's journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inspection was carelessly made, the leaf being kept open by the aid of
      one hand, whilst the other still held his cup of coffee; much more
      carelessly than would have been the case had the expected new-comer been
      Cytherea Graye, instead of his lawful wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not perceive, branching from the column down which his finger ran,
      a small twist, called a shunting-line, inserted at a particular place, to
      imply that at that point the train was divided into two. By this oversight
      he understood that the arrival of his wife at Carriford Road Station would
      not be till late in the evening: by the second half of the train,
      containing the third-class passengers, and passing two hours and
      three-quarters later than the previous one, by which the lady, as a
      second-class passenger, would really be brought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then considered that there would be plenty of time for him to return
      from his day's engagement to meet this train. He finished his breakfast,
      gave proper and precise directions to his servant on the preparations that
      were to be made for the lady's reception, jumped into his gig, and drove
      off to Lord Claydonfield's, at Chettlewood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went along by the front of Knapwater House. He could not help turning
      to look at what he knew to be the window of Cytherea's room. Whilst he
      looked, a hopeless expression of passionate love and sensuous anguish came
      upon his face and lingered there for a few seconds; then, as on previous
      occasions, it was resolutely repressed, and he trotted along the smooth
      white road, again endeavouring to banish all thought of the young girl
      whose beauty and grace had so enslaved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was that when, in the evening of the same day, Mrs. Manston
      reached Carriford Road Station, her husband was still at Chettlewood,
      ignorant of her arrival, and on looking up and down the platform, dreary
      with autumn gloom and wind, she could see no sign that any preparation
      whatever had been made for her reception and conduct home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train went on. She waited, fidgeted with the handle of her umbrella,
      walked about, strained her eyes into the gloom of the chilly night,
      listened for wheels, tapped with her foot, and showed all the usual signs
      of annoyance and irritation: she was the more irritated in that this
      seemed a second and culminating instance of her husband's neglect&mdash;the
      first having been shown in his not fetching her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reflecting awhile upon the course it would be best to take, in order to
      secure a passage to Knapwater, she decided to leave all her luggage,
      except a dressing-bag, in the cloak-room, and walk to her husband's house,
      as she had done on her first visit. She asked one of the porters if he
      could find a lad to go with her and carry her bag: he offered to do it
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The porter was a good-tempered, shallow-minded, ignorant man. Mrs.
      Manston, being apparently in very gloomy spirits, would probably have
      preferred walking beside him without saying a word: but her companion
      would not allow silence to continue between them for a longer period than
      two or three minutes together.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had volunteered several remarks upon her arrival, chiefly to the effect
      that it was very unfortunate Mr. Manston had not come to the station for
      her, when she suddenly asked him concerning the inhabitants of the parish.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told her categorically the names of the chief&mdash;first the chief
      possessors of property; then of brains; then of good looks. As first among
      the latter he mentioned Miss Cytherea Graye.
    </p>
    <p>
      After getting him to describe her appearance as completely as lay in his
      power, she wormed out of him the statement that everybody had been saying&mdash;before
      Mrs. Manston's existence was heard of&mdash;how well the handsome Mr.
      Manston and the beautiful Miss Graye were suited for each other as man and
      wife, and that Miss Aldclyffe was the only one in the parish who took no
      interest in bringing about the match.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He rather liked her you think?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The porter began to think he had been too explicit, and hastened to
      correct the error.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no, he don't care a bit about her, ma'am,' he said solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not more than he does about me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not a bit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then that must be little indeed,' Mrs. Manston murmured. She stood still,
      as if reflecting upon the painful neglect her words had recalled to her
      mind; then, with a sudden impulse, turned round, and walked petulantly a
      few steps back again in the direction of the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      The porter stood still and looked surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll go back again; yes, indeed, I'll go back again!' she said
      plaintively. Then she paused and looked anxiously up and down the deserted
      road.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I mustn't go back now,' she continued, in a tone of resignation.
      Seeing that the porter was watching her, she turned about and came on as
      before, giving vent to a slight laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a laugh full of character; the low forced laugh which seeks to hide
      the painful perception of a humiliating position under the mask of
      indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether her conduct had shown her to be what in fact she was, a weak,
      though a calculating woman, one clever to conceive, weak to execute: one
      whose best-laid schemes were for ever liable to be frustrated by the
      ineradicable blight of vacillation at the critical hour of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, if I had only known that all this was going to happen!' she murmured
      again, as they paced along upon the rustling leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What did you say, ma'am?' said the porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, nothing particular; we are getting near the old manor-house by this
      time, I imagine?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very near now, ma'am.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They soon reached Manston's residence, round which the wind blew
      mournfully and chill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing under the detached gateway, they entered the porch. The porter
      stepped forward, knocked heavily and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Manston then advanced to the door and gave a different series of
      rappings&mdash;less forcible, but more sustained.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not a movement of any kind inside, not a ray of light visible;
      nothing but the echo of her own knocks through the passages, and the dry
      scratching of the withered leaves blown about her feet upon the floor of
      the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steward, of course, was not at home. Mrs. Crickett, not expecting that
      anybody would arrive till the time of the later train, had set the place
      in order, laid the supper-table, and then locked the door, to go into the
      village and converse with her friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is there an inn in the village?' said Mrs. Manston, after the fourth and
      loudest rapping upon the iron-studded old door had resulted only in the
      fourth and loudest echo from the passages inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, ma'am.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who keeps it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Farmer Springrove.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will go there to-night,' she said decisively. 'It is too cold, and
      altogether too bad, for a woman to wait in the open road on anybody's
      account, gentle or simple.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They went down the park and through the gate, into the village of
      Carriford. By the time they reached the Three Tranters, it was verging
      upon ten o'clock. There, on the spot where two months earlier in the
      season the sunny and lively group of villagers making cider under the
      trees had greeted Cytherea's eyes, was nothing now intelligible but a vast
      cloak of darkness, from which came the low sough of the elms, and the
      occasional creak of the swinging sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went to the door, Mrs. Manston shivering; but less from the cold,
      than from the dreariness of her emotions. Neglect is the coldest of winter
      winds.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened that Edward Springrove was expected to arrive from London
      either on that evening or the next, and at the sound of voices his father
      came to the door fully expecting to see him. A picture of disappointment
      seldom witnessed in a man's face was visible in old Mr. Springrove's, when
      he saw that the comer was a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Manston asked for a room, and one that had been prepared for Edward
      was immediately named as being ready for her, another being adaptable for
      Edward, should he come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without taking any refreshment, or entering any room downstairs, or even
      lifting her veil, she walked straight along the passage and up to her
      apartment, the chambermaid preceding her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If Mr. Manston comes to-night,' she said, sitting on the bed as she had
      come in, and addressing the woman, 'tell him I cannot see him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, ma'am.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman left the room, and Mrs. Manston locked the door. Before the
      servant had gone down more than two or three stairs, Mrs. Manston
      unfastened the door again, and held it ajar.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bring me some brandy,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chambermaid went down to the bar and brought up the spirit in a
      tumbler. When she came into the room, Mrs. Manston had not removed a
      single article of apparel, and was walking up and down, as if still quite
      undecided upon the course it was best to adopt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the door, when it was closed upon her, the maid paused to listen
      for an instant. She heard Mrs. Manston talking to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This is welcome home!' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. FROM TEN TO HALF-PAST ELEVEN P.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange concurrence of phenomena now confronts us.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the autumn in which the past scenes were enacted, Mr. Springrove
      had ploughed, harrowed, and cleaned a narrow and shaded piece of ground,
      lying at the back of his house, which for many years had been looked upon
      as irreclaimable waste.
    </p>
    <p>
      The couch-grass extracted from the soil had been left to wither in the
      sun; afterwards it was raked together, lighted in the customary way, and
      now lay smouldering in a large heap in the middle of the plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been kindled three days previous to Mrs. Manston's arrival, and one
      or two villagers, of a more cautious and less sanguine temperament than
      Springrove, had suggested that the fire was almost too near the back of
      the house for its continuance to be unattended with risk; for though no
      danger could be apprehended whilst the air remained moderately still, a
      brisk breeze blowing towards the house might possibly carry a spark
      across.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, that's true enough,' said Springrove. 'I must look round before going
      to bed and see that everything's safe; but to tell the truth I am anxious
      to get the rubbish burnt up before the rain comes to wash it into ground
      again. As to carrying the couch into the back field to burn, and bringing
      it back again, why, 'tis more than the ashes would be worth.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, that's very true,' said the neighbours, and passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three times during the first evening after the heap was lit, he
      went to the back door to take a survey. Before bolting and barring up for
      the night, he made a final and more careful examination. The
      slowly-smoking pile showed not the slightest signs of activity.
      Springrove's perfectly sound conclusion was, that as long as the heap was
      not stirred, and the wind continued in the quarter it blew from then, the
      couch would not flame, and that there could be no shadow of danger to
      anything, even a combustible substance, though it were no more than a yard
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the burning couch was discovered in precisely the same
      state as when he had gone to bed the preceding night. The heap smoked in
      the same manner the whole of that day: at bed-time the farmer looked
      towards it, but less carefully than on the first night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning and the whole of the third day still saw the heap in its old
      smouldering condition; indeed, the smoke was less, and there seemed a
      probability that it might have to be re-kindled on the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      After admitting Mrs. Manston to his house in the evening, and hearing her
      retire, Mr. Springrove returned to the front door to listen for a sound of
      his son, and inquired concerning him of the railway-porter, who sat for a
      while in the kitchen. The porter had not noticed young Mr. Springrove get
      out of the train, at which intelligence the old man concluded that he
      would probably not see his son till the next day, as Edward had hitherto
      made a point of coming by the train which had brought Mrs. Manston.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-an-hour later the porter left the inn, Springrove at the same time
      going to the door to listen again an instant, then he walked round and in
      at the back of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer glanced at the heap casually and indifferently in passing; two
      nights of safety seemed to ensure the third; and he was about to bolt and
      bar as usual, when the idea struck him that there was just a possibility
      of his son's return by the latest train, unlikely as it was that he would
      be so delayed. The old man thereupon left the door unfastened, looked to
      his usual matters indoors, and went to bed, it being then half-past ten
      o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farmers and horticulturists well know that it is in the nature of a heap
      of couch-grass, when kindled in calm weather, to smoulder for many days,
      and even weeks, until the whole mass is reduced to a powdery charcoal ash,
      displaying the while scarcely a sign of combustion beyond the volcano-like
      smoke from its summit; but the continuance of this quiet process is
      throughout its length at the mercy of one particular whim of Nature: that
      is, a sudden breeze, by which the heap is liable to be fanned into a flame
      so brisk as to consume the whole in an hour or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the farmer narrowly watched the pile when he went to close the door,
      he would have seen, besides the familiar twine of smoke from its summit, a
      quivering of the air around the mass, showing that a considerable heat had
      arisen inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the railway-porter turned the corner of the row of houses adjoining the
      Three Tranters, a brisk new wind greeted his face, and spread past him
      into the village. He walked along the high-road till he came to a gate,
      about three hundred yards from the inn. Over the gate could be discerned
      the situation of the building he had just quitted. He carelessly turned
      his head in passing, and saw behind him a clear red glow indicating the
      position of the couch-heap: a glow without a flame, increasing and
      diminishing in brightness as the breeze quickened or fell, like the coal
      of a newly lighted cigar. If those cottages had been his, he thought, he
      should not care to have a fire so near them as that&mdash;and the wind
      rising. But the cottages not being his, he went on his way to the station,
      where he was about to resume duty for the night. The road was now quite
      deserted: till four o'clock the next morning, when the carters would go by
      to the stables there was little probability of any human being passing the
      Three Tranters Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      By eleven, everybody in the house was asleep. It truly seemed as if the
      treacherous element knew there had arisen a grand opportunity for
      devastation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a quarter past eleven a slight stealthy crackle made itself heard amid
      the increasing moans of the night wind; the heap glowed brighter still,
      and burst into a flame; the flame sank, another breeze entered it,
      sustained it, and it grew to be first continuous and weak, then continuous
      and strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      At twenty minutes past eleven a blast of wind carried an airy bit of
      ignited fern several yards forward, in a direction parallel to the houses
      and inn, and there deposited it on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes later another puff of wind carried a similar piece to a
      distance of five-and-twenty yards, where it also was dropped softly on the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the wind did not blow in the direction of the houses, and even now
      to a casual observer they would have appeared safe. But Nature does few
      things directly. A minute later yet, an ignited fragment fell upon the
      straw covering of a long thatched heap or 'grave' of mangel-wurzel, lying
      in a direction at right angles to the house, and down toward the hedge.
      There the fragment faded to darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short time subsequent to this, after many intermediate deposits and
      seemingly baffled attempts, another fragment fell on the mangel-wurzel
      grave, and continued to glow; the glow was increased by the wind; the
      straw caught fire and burst into flame. It was inevitable that the flame
      should run along the ridge of the thatch towards a piggery at the end. Yet
      had the piggery been tiled, the time-honoured hostel would even now at
      this last moment have been safe; but it was constructed as piggeries are
      mostly constructed, of wood and thatch. The hurdles and straw roof of the
      frail erection became ignited in their turn, and abutting as the shed did
      on the back of the inn, flamed up to the eaves of the main roof in less
      than thirty seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. HALF-PAST ELEVEN TO TWELVE P.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hazardous length of time elapsed before the inmates of the Three
      Tranters knew of their danger. When at length the discovery was made, the
      rush was a rush for bare life.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man's voice calling, then screams, then loud stamping and shouts were
      heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Springrove ran out first. Two minutes later appeared the ostler and
      chambermaid, who were man and wife. The inn, as has been stated, was a
      quaint old building, and as inflammable as a bee-hive; it overhung the
      base at the level of the first floor, and again overhung at the eaves,
      which were finished with heavy oak barge-boards; every atom in its
      substance, every feature in its construction, favoured the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The forked flames, lurid and smoky, became nearly lost to view, bursting
      forth again with a bound and loud crackle, increased tenfold in power and
      brightness. The crackling grew sharper. Long quivering shadows began to be
      flung from the stately trees at the end of the house; the square outline
      of the church tower, on the other side of the way, which had hitherto been
      a dark mass against a sky comparatively light, now began to appear as a
      light object against a sky of darkness; and even the narrow surface of the
      flag-staff at the top could be seen in its dark surrounding, brought out
      from its obscurity by the rays from the dancing light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shouts and other noises increased in loudness and frequency. The lapse of
      ten minutes brought most of the inhabitants of that end of the village
      into the street, followed in a short time by the rector, Mr. Raunham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Casting a hasty glance up and down, he beckoned to one or two of the men,
      and vanished again. In a short time wheels were heard, and Mr. Raunham and
      the men reappeared, with the garden engine, the only one in the village,
      except that at Knapwater House. After some little trouble the hose was
      connected with a tank in the old stable-yard, and the puny instrument
      began to play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several seemed paralyzed at first, and stood transfixed, their rigid faces
      looking like red-hot iron in the glaring light. In the confusion a woman
      cried, 'Ring the bells backwards!' and three or four of the old and
      superstitious entered the belfry and jangled them indescribably. Some were
      only half dressed, and, to add to the horror, among them was Clerk
      Crickett, running up and down with a face streaming with blood, ghastly
      and pitiful to see, his excitement being so great that he had not the
      slightest conception of how, when, or where he came by the wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd was now busy at work, and tried to save a little of the
      furniture of the inn. The only room they could enter was the parlour, from
      which they managed to bring out the bureau, a few chairs, some old silver
      candlesticks, and half-a-dozen light articles; but these were all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fiery mats of thatch slid off the roof and fell into the road with a
      deadened thud, whilst white flakes of straw and wood-ash were flying in
      the wind like feathers. At the same time two of the cottages adjoining,
      upon which a little water had been brought to play from the rector's
      engine, were seen to be on fire. The attenuated spirt of water was as
      nothing upon the heated and dry surface of the thatched roof; the fire
      prevailed without a minute's hindrance, and dived through to the rafters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly arose a cry, 'Where's Mr. Springrove?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He had vanished from the spot by the churchyard wall, where he had been
      standing a few minutes earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I fancy he's gone inside,' said a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Madness and folly! what can he save?' said another. 'Good God, find him!
      Help here!'
    </p>
    <p>
      A wild rush was made at the door, which had fallen to, and in defiance of
      the scorching flame that burst forth, three men forced themselves through
      it. Immediately inside the threshold they found the object of their search
      lying senseless on the floor of the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      To bring him out and lay him on a bank was the work of an instant; a basin
      of cold water was dashed in his face, and he began to recover
      consciousness, but very slowly. He had been saved by a miracle. No sooner
      were his preservers out of the building than the window-frames lit up as
      if by magic with deep and waving fringes of flames. Simultaneously, the
      joints of the boards forming the front door started into view as glowing
      bars of fire: a star of red light penetrated the centre, gradually
      increasing in size till the flames rushed forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the staircase fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Everybody is out safe,' said a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, thank God!' said three or four others.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, we forgot that a stranger came! I think she is safe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope she is,' said the weak voice of some one coming up from behind. It
      was the chambermaid's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Springrove at that moment aroused himself; he staggered to his feet, and
      threw his hands up wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Everybody, no! no! The lady who came by train, Mrs. Manston! I tried to
      fetch her out, but I fell.'
    </p>
    <p>
      An exclamation of horror burst from the crowd; it was caused partly by
      this disclosure of Springrove, more by the added perception which followed
      his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      An average interval of about three minutes had elapsed between one
      intensely fierce gust of wind and the next, and now another poured over
      them; the roof swayed, and a moment afterwards fell in with a crash,
      pulling the gable after it, and thrusting outwards the front wall of
      wood-work, which fell into the road with a rumbling echo; a cloud of black
      dust, myriads of sparks, and a great outburst of flame followed the uproar
      of the fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who is she? what is she?' burst from every lip again and again,
      incoherently, and without leaving a sufficient pause for a reply, had a
      reply been volunteered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The autumn wind, tameless, and swift, and proud, still blew upon the dying
      old house, which was constructed so entirely of combustible materials that
      it burnt almost as fiercely as a corn-rick. The heat in the road
      increased, and now for an instant at the height of the conflagration all
      stood still, and gazed silently, awestruck and helpless, in the presence
      of so irresistible an enemy. Then, with minds full of the tragedy unfolded
      to them, they rushed forward again with the obtuse directness of waves, to
      their labour of saving goods from the houses adjoining, which it was
      evident were all doomed to destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minutes passed by. The Three Tranters Inn sank into a mere heap of
      red-hot charcoal: the fire pushed its way down the row as the church clock
      opposite slowly struck the hour of midnight, and the bewildered chimes,
      scarcely heard amid the crackling of the flames, wandered through the
      wayward air of the Old Hundred-and-Thirteenth Psalm.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. NINE TO ELEVEN P.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston mounted his gig and set out from Chettlewood that evening in no
      very enviable frame of mind. The thought of domestic life in Knapwater Old
      House, with the now eclipsed wife of the past, was more than disagreeable,
      was positively distasteful to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he knew that the influential position, which, from whatever fortunate
      cause, he held on Miss Aldclyffe's manor, would never again fall to his
      lot on any other, and he tacitly assented to this dilemma, hoping that
      some consolation or other would soon suggest itself to him; married as he
      was, he was near Cytherea.
    </p>
    <p>
      He occasionally looked at his watch as he drove along the lanes, timing
      the pace of his horse by the hour, that he might reach Carriford Road
      Station just soon enough to meet the last London train.
    </p>
    <p>
      He soon began to notice in the sky a slight yellow halo, near the horizon.
      It rapidly increased; it changed colour, and grew redder; then the glare
      visibly brightened and dimmed at intervals, showing that its origin was
      affected by the strong wind prevailing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston reined in his horse on the summit of a hill, and considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is a rick-yard on fire,' he thought; 'no house could produce such a
      raging flame so suddenly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He trotted on again, attempting to particularize the local features in the
      neighbourhood of the fire; but this it was too dark to do, and the
      excessive winding of the roads misled him as to its direction, not being
      an old inhabitant of the district, or a countryman used to forming such
      judgments; whilst the brilliancy of the light shortened its real
      remoteness to an apparent distance of not more than half: it seemed so
      near that he again stopped his horse, this time to listen; but he could
      hear no sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering now a narrow valley, the sides of which obscured the sky to an
      angle of perhaps thirty or forty degrees above the mathematical horizon,
      he was obliged to suspend his judgment till he was in possession of
      further knowledge, having however assumed in the interim, that the fire
      was somewhere between Carriford Road Station and the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      The self-same glare had just arrested the eyes of another man. He was at
      that minute gliding along several miles to the east of the steward's
      position, but nearing the same point as that to which Manston tended. The
      younger Edward Springrove was returning from London to his father's house
      by the identical train which the steward was expecting to bring his wife,
      the truth being that Edward's lateness was owing to the simplest of all
      causes, his temporary want of money, which led him to make a slow journey
      for the sake of travelling at third-class fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Springrove had received Cytherea's bitter and admonitory letter, and he
      was clearly awakened to a perception of the false position in which he had
      placed himself, by keeping silence at Budmouth on his long engagement. An
      increasing reluctance to put an end to those few days of ecstasy with
      Cytherea had overruled his conscience, and tied his tongue till speaking
      was too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why did I do it? how could I dream of loving her?' he asked himself as he
      walked by day, as he tossed on his bed by night: 'miserable folly!'
    </p>
    <p>
      An impressionable heart had for years&mdash;perhaps as many as six or
      seven years&mdash;been distracting him, by unconsciously setting itself to
      yearn for somebody wanting, he scarcely knew whom. Echoes of himself,
      though rarely, he now and then found. Sometimes they were men, sometimes
      women, his cousin Adelaide being one of these; for in spite of a fashion
      which pervades the whole community at the present day&mdash;the habit of
      exclaiming that woman is not undeveloped man, but diverse, the fact
      remains that, after all, women are Mankind, and that in many of the
      sentiments of life the difference of sex is but a difference of degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the indefinable helpmate to the remoter sides of himself still
      continued invisible. He grew older, and concluded that the ideas, or
      rather emotions, which possessed him on the subject, were probably too
      unreal ever to be found embodied in the flesh of a woman. Thereupon, he
      developed a plan of satisfying his dreams by wandering away to the
      heroines of poetical imagination, and took no further thought on the
      earthly realization of his formless desire, in more homely matters
      satisfying himself with his cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea appeared in the sky: his heart started up and spoke:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'Tis She, and here
     Lo! I unclothe and clear
     My wishes' cloudy character.'
</pre>
    <p>
      Some women kindle emotion so rapidly in a man's heart that the judgment
      cannot keep pace with its rise, and finds, on comprehending the situation,
      that faithfulness to the old love is already treachery to the new. Such
      women are not necessarily the greatest of their sex, but there are very
      few of them. Cytherea was one.
    </p>
    <p>
      On receiving the letter from her he had taken to thinking over these
      things, and had not answered it at all. But 'hungry generations' soon
      tread down the muser in a city. At length he thought of the strong
      necessity of living. After a dreary search, the negligence of which was
      ultimately overcome by mere conscientiousness, he obtained a situation as
      assistant to an architect in the neighbourhood of Charing Cross: the
      duties would not begin till after the lapse of a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not at first decide whither he should go to spend the intervening
      time; but in the midst of his reasonings he found himself on the road
      homeward, impelled by a secret and unowned hope of getting a last glimpse
      of Cytherea there.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. MIDNIGHT
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a quarter to twelve when Manston drove into the station-yard. The
      train was punctual, and the bell, announcing its arrival, rang as he
      crossed the booking-office to go out upon the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      The porter who had accompanied Mrs. Manston to Carriford, and had returned
      to the station on his night duty, recognized the steward as he entered,
      and immediately came towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. Manston came by the nine o'clock train, sir,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steward gave vent to an expression of vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Her luggage is here, sir,' the porter said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Put it up behind me in the gig if it is not too much,' said Manston.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Directly this train is in and gone, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The man vanished and crossed the line to meet the entering train.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where is that fire?' Manston said to the booking-clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the clerk could speak, another man ran in and answered the question
      without having heard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Half Carriford is burnt down, or will be!' he exclaimed. 'You can't see
      the flames from this station on account of the trees, but step on the
      bridge&mdash;'tis tremendous!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He also crossed the line to assist at the entry of the train, which came
      in the next minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steward stood in the office. One passenger alighted, gave up his
      ticket, and crossed the room in front of Manston: a young man with a black
      bag and umbrella in his hand. He passed out of the door, down the steps,
      and struck out into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who was that young man?' said Manston, when the porter had returned. The
      young man, by a kind of magnetism, had drawn the steward's thoughts after
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's an architect.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My own old profession. I could have sworn it by the cut of him,' Manston
      murmured. 'What's his name?' he said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Springrove&mdash;Farmer Springrove's son, Edward.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Farmer Springrove's son, Edward,' the steward repeated to himself, and
      considered a matter to which the words had painfully recalled his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matter was Miss Aldclyffe's mention of the young man as Cytherea's
      lover, which, indeed, had scarcely ever been absent from his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But for the existence of my wife that man might have been my rival,' he
      pondered, following the porter, who had now come back to him, into the
      luggage-room. And whilst the man was carrying out and putting in one box,
      which was sufficiently portable for the gig, Manston still thought, as his
      eyes watched the process&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'But for my wife, Springrove might have been my rival.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He examined the lamps of his gig, carefully laid out the reins, mounted
      the seat and drove along the turnpike-road towards Knapwater Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exact locality of the fire was plain to him as he neared home. He soon
      could hear the shout of men, the flapping of the flames, the crackling of
      burning wood, and could smell the smoke from the conflagration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of a sudden, a few yards ahead, within the compass of the rays from the
      right-hand lamp, burst forward the figure of a man. Having been walking in
      darkness the newcomer raised his hands to his eyes, on approaching nearer,
      to screen them from the glare of the reflector.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston saw that he was one of the villagers: a small farmer originally,
      who had drunk himself down to a day-labourer and reputed poacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hoy!' cried Manston, aloud, that the man might step aside out of the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is that Mr. Manston?' said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Somebody ha' come to Carriford: and the rest of it may concern you, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, well.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you expect Mrs. Manston to-night, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, unfortunately she's come, I know, and asleep long before this time,
      I suppose.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The labourer leant his elbow upon the shaft of the gig and turned his
      face, pale and sweating from his late work at the fire, up to Manston's.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, she did come,' he said.... 'I beg pardon, sir, but I should be glad
      of&mdash;of&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Glad of a trifle for bringen ye the news.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not a farthing! I didn't want your news, I knew she was come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Won't you give me a shillen, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly not.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then will you lend me a shillen, sir? I be tired out, and don't know what
      to do. If I don't pay you back some day I'll be d&mdash;d.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The devil is so cheated that perdition isn't worth a penny as a
      security.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let me go on,' said Manston.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thy wife is <i>dead</i>; that's the rest o' the news,' said the labourer
      slowly. He waited for a reply; none came.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She went to the Three Tranters, because she couldn't get into thy house,
      the burnen roof fell in upon her before she could be called up, and she's
      a cinder, as thou'lt be some day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That will do, let me drive on,' said the steward calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Expectation of a concussion may be so intense that its failure strikes the
      brain with more force than its fulfilment. The labourer sank back into the
      ditch. Such a Cushi could not realize the possibility of such an unmoved
      David as this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston drove hastily to the turning of the road, tied his horse, and ran
      on foot to the site of the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stagnation caused by the awful accident had been passed through, and
      all hands were helping to remove from the remaining cottage what furniture
      they could lay hold of; the thatch of the roofs being already on fire. The
      Knapwater fire-engine had arrived on the spot, but it was small, and
      ineffectual. A group was collected round the rector, who in a coat which
      had become bespattered, scorched, and torn in his exertions, was directing
      on one hand the proceedings relative to the removal of goods into the
      church, and with the other was pointing out the spot on which it was most
      desirable that the puny engines at their disposal should be made to play.
      Every tongue was instantly silent at the sight of Manston's pale and clear
      countenance, which contrasted strangely with the grimy and streaming faces
      of the toiling villagers.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Was she burnt?' he said in a firm though husky voice, and stepping into
      the illuminated area. The rector came to him, and took him aside. 'Is she
      burnt?' repeated Manston.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is dead: but thank God, she was spared the horrid agony of burning,'
      the rector said solemnly; 'the roof and gable fell in upon her, and
      crushed her. Instant death must have followed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why was she here?' said Manston.
    </p>
    <p>
      'From what we can hurriedly collect, it seems that she found the door of
      your house locked, and concluded that you had retired, the fact being that
      your servant, Mrs. Crickett, had gone out to supper. She then came back to
      the inn and went to bed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where's the landlord?' said Manston.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Springrove came up, walking feebly, and wrapped in a cloak, and
      corroborated the evidence given by the rector.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did she look ill, or annoyed, when she came?' said the steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't say. I didn't see; but I think&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do you think?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She was much put out about something.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My not meeting her, naturally,' murmured the other, lost in reverie. He
      turned his back on Springrove and the rector, and retired from the shining
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything had been done that could be done with the limited means at
      their disposal. The whole row of houses was destroyed, and each presented
      itself as one stage of a series, progressing from smoking ruins at the end
      where the inn had stood, to a partly flaming mass&mdash;glowing as none
      but wood embers will glow&mdash;at the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      A feature in the decline of town fires was noticeably absent here&mdash;steam.
      There was present what is not observable in towns&mdash;incandescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heat, and the smarting effect upon their eyes of the strong smoke from
      the burning oak and deal, had at last driven the villagers back from the
      road in front of the houses, and they now stood in groups in the
      churchyard, the surface of which, raised by the interments of generations,
      stood four or five feet above the level of the road, and almost even with
      the top of the low wall dividing one from the other. The headstones stood
      forth whitely against the dark grass and yews, their brightness being
      repeated on the white smock-frocks of some of the labourers, and in a
      mellower, ruddier form on their faces and hands, on those of the grinning
      gargoyles, and on other salient stonework of the weather-beaten church in
      the background.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rector had decided that, under the distressing circumstances of the
      case, there would be no sacrilege in placing in the church, for the night,
      the pieces of furniture and utensils which had been saved from the several
      houses. There was no other place of safety for them, and they accordingly
      were gathered there.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. HALF-PAST TWELVE TO ONE A.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston, when he retired to meditate, had walked round the churchyard, and
      now entered the opened door of the building.
    </p>
    <p>
      He mechanically pursued his way round the piers into his own seat in the
      north aisle. The lower atmosphere of this spot was shaded by its own wall
      from the shine which streamed in over the window-sills on the same side.
      The only light burning inside the church was a small tallow candle,
      standing in the font, in the opposite aisle of the building to that in
      which Manston had sat down, and near where the furniture was piled. The
      candle's mild rays were overpowered by the ruddier light from the ruins,
      making the weak flame to appear like the moon by day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting there he saw Farmer Springrove enter the door, followed by his son
      Edward, still carrying his travelling-bag in his hand. They were speaking
      of the sad death of Mrs. Manston, but the subject was relinquished for
      that of the houses burnt.
    </p>
    <p>
      This row of houses, running from the inn eastward, had been built under
      the following circumstances:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifty years before this date, the spot upon which the cottages afterwards
      stood was a blank strip, along the side of the village street, difficult
      to cultivate, on account of the outcrop thereon of a large bed of flints
      called locally a 'lanch' or 'lanchet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The Aldclyffe then in possession of the estate conceived the idea that a
      row of cottages would be an improvement to the spot, and accordingly
      granted leases of portions to several respectable inhabitants. Each lessee
      was to be subject to the payment of a merely nominal rent for the whole
      term of lives, on condition that he built his own cottage, and delivered
      it up intact at the end of the term.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who had built had, one by one, relinquished their indentures, either
      by sale or barter, to Farmer Springrove's father. New lives were added in
      some cases, by payment of a sum to the lord of the manor, etc., and all
      the leases were now held by the farmer himself, as one of the chief
      provisions for his old age.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steward had become interested in the following conversation:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Try not to be so depressed, father; they are all insured.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The words came from Edward in an anxious tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You mistake, Edward; they are not insured,' returned the old man
      gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not?' the son asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not one!' said the farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'In the Helmet Fire Office, surely?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'They were insured there every one. Six months ago the office, which had
      been raising the premiums on thatched premises higher for some years, gave
      up insuring them altogether, as two or three other fire-offices had done
      previously, on account, they said, of the uncertainty and greatness of the
      risk of thatch undetached. Ever since then I have been continually
      intending to go to another office, but have never gone. Who expects a
      fire?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you remember the terms of the leases?' said Edward, still more
      uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, not particularly,' said his father absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where are they?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In the bureau there; that's why I tried to save it first, among other
      things.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, we must see to that at once.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do you want?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The key.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They went into the south aisle, took the candle from the font, and then
      proceeded to open the bureau, which had been placed in a corner under the
      gallery. Both leant over upon the flap; Edward holding the candle, whilst
      his father took the pieces of parchment from one of the drawers, and
      spread the first out before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You read it, Ted. I can't see without my glasses. This one will be
      sufficient. The terms of all are the same.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward took the parchment, and read quickly and indistinctly for some
      time; then aloud and slowly as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'And the said John Springrove for himself his heirs executors and
      administrators doth covenant and agree with the said Gerald Fellcourt
      Aldclyffe his heirs and assigns that he the said John Springrove his heirs
      and assigns during the said term shall pay unto the said Gerald Fellcourt
      Aldclyffe his heirs and assigns the clear yearly rent of ten shillings and
      sixpence.... at the several times hereinbefore appointed for the payment
      thereof respectively. And also shall and at all times during the said term
      well and sufficiently repair and keep the said Cottage or Dwelling-house
      and all other the premises and all houses or buildings erected or to be
      erected thereupon in good and proper repair in every respect without
      exception and the said premises in such good repair upon the determination
      of this demise shall yield up unto the said Gerald Fellcourt Aldclyffe his
      heirs and assigns.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They closed the bureau and turned towards the door of the church without
      speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston also had come forward out of the gloom. Notwithstanding the
      farmer's own troubles, an instinctive respect and generous sense of
      sympathy with the steward for his awful loss caused the old man to step
      aside, that Manston might pass out without speaking to them if he chose to
      do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who is he?' whispered Edward to his father, as Manston approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Manston, the steward.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston came near, and passed down the aisle on the side of the younger
      man. Their faces came almost close together: one large flame, which still
      lingered upon the ruins outside, threw long dancing shadows of each across
      the nave till they bent upwards against the aisle wall, and also
      illuminated their eyes, as each met those of the other. Edward had learnt,
      by a letter from home, of the steward's passion for Cytherea, and his
      mysterious repression of it, afterwards explained by his marriage. That
      marriage was now nought. Edward realized the man's newly acquired freedom,
      and felt an instinctive enmity towards him&mdash;he would hardly own to
      himself why. The steward, too, knew Cytherea's attachment to Edward, and
      looked keenly and inscrutably at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. ONE TO TWO A.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston went homeward alone, his heart full of strange emotions. Entering
      the house, and dismissing the woman to her own home, he at once proceeded
      upstairs to his bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reasoning worldliness, especially when allied with sensuousness, cannot
      repress on some extreme occasions the human instinct to pour out the soul
      to some Being or Personality, who in frigid moments is dismissed with the
      title of Chance, or at most Law. Manston was selfishly and inhumanly, but
      honestly and unutterably, thankful for the recent catastrophe. Beside his
      bed, for that first time during a period of nearly twenty years, he fell
      down upon his knees in a passionate outburst of feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many minutes passed before he arose. He walked to the window, and then
      seemed to remember for the first time that some action on his part was
      necessary in connection with the sad circumstance of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the house at once, he went to the scene of the fire, arriving
      there in time to hear the rector making an arrangement with a certain
      number of men to watch the spot till morning. The ashes were still red-hot
      and flaming. Manston found that nothing could be done towards searching
      them at that hour of the night. He turned homeward again, in the company
      of the rector, who had considerately persuaded him to retire from the
      scene for a while, and promised that as soon as a man could live amid the
      embers of the Three Tranters Inn, they should be carefully searched for
      the remains of his unfortunate wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston then went indoors, to wait for morning.

    <h2>
      XI. THE EVENTS OF FIVE DAYS
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1. NOVEMBER THE TWENTY-NINTH
    </h3>
    <p>
      The search began at dawn, but a quarter past nine o'clock came without
      bringing any result. Manston ate a little breakfast, and crossed the
      hollow of the park which intervened between the old and modern
      manor-houses, to ask for an interview with Miss Aldclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He met her midway. She was about to pay him a visit of condolence, and to
      place every man on the estate at his disposal, that the search for any
      relic of his dead and destroyed wife might not be delayed an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      He accompanied her back to the house. At first they conversed as if the
      death of the poor woman was an event which the husband must of necessity
      deeply lament; and when all under this head that social form seemed to
      require had been uttered, they spoke of the material damage done, and of
      the steps which had better be taken to remedy it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not till both were shut inside her private room that she spoke to
      him in her blunt and cynical manner. A certain newness of bearing in him,
      peculiar to the present morning, had hitherto forbidden her this tone: the
      demeanour of the subject of her favouritism had altered, she could not
      tell in what way. He was entirely a changed man.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are you really sorry for your poor wife, Mr. Manston?' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I am,' he answered shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But only as for any human being who has met with a violent death?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He confessed it&mdash;'For she was not a good woman,' he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should be sorry to say such a thing now the poor creature is dead,'
      Miss Aldclyffe returned reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why?' he asked. 'Why should I praise her if she doesn't deserve it? I say
      exactly what I have often admired Sterne for saying in one of his letters&mdash;that
      neither reason nor Scripture asks us to speak nothing but good of the
      dead. And now, madam,' he continued, after a short interval of thought, 'I
      may, perhaps, hope that you will assist me, or rather not thwart me, in
      endeavouring to win the love of a young lady living about you, one in whom
      I am much interested already.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cytherea!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, Cytherea.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You have been loving Cytherea all the while?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Surprise was a preface to much agitation in her, which caused her to rise
      from her seat, and pace to the side of the room. The steward quietly
      looked on and added, 'I have been loving and still love her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She came close up to him, wistfully contemplating his face, one hand
      moving indecisively at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And your secret marriage was, then, the true and only reason for that
      backwardness regarding the courtship of Cytherea, which, they tell me, has
      been the talk of the village; not your indifference to her attractions.'
      Her voice had a tone of conviction in it, as well as of inquiry; but none
      of jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' he said; 'and not a dishonourable one. What held me back was just
      that one thing&mdash;a sense of morality that perhaps, madam, you did not
      give me credit for.' The latter words were spoken with a mien and tone of
      pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe preserved silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And now,' he went on, 'I may as well say a word in vindication of my
      conduct lately, at the risk, too, of offending you. My actual motive in
      submitting to your order that I should send for my late wife, and live
      with her, was not the mercenary policy of wishing to retain an office
      which brings me greater comforts than any I have enjoyed before, but this
      unquenchable passion for Cytherea. Though I saw the weakness, folly, and
      even wickedness of it continually, it still forced me to try to continue
      near her, even as the husband of another woman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited for her to speak: she did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's a great obstacle to my making any way in winning Miss Graye's
      love,' he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, Edward Springrove,' she said quietly. 'I know it, I did once want to
      see them married; they have had a slight quarrel, and it will soon be made
      up again, unless&mdash;' she spoke as if she had only half attended to
      Manston's last statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is already engaged to be married to somebody else,' said the steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pooh!' said she, 'you mean to his cousin at Peakhill; that's nothing to
      help us; he's now come home to break it off.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He must not break it off,' said Manston, firmly and calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His tone attracted her, startled her. Recovering herself, she said
      haughtily, 'Well, that's your affair, not mine. Though my wish has been to
      see her <i>your</i> wife, I can't do anything dishonourable to bring about
      such a result.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But it must be <i>made</i> your affair,' he said in a hard, steady voice,
      looking into her eyes, as if he saw there the whole panorama of her past.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most difficult things to portray by written words is that
      peculiar mixture of moods expressed in a woman's countenance when, after
      having been sedulously engaged in establishing another's position, she
      suddenly suspects him of undermining her own. It was thus that Miss
      Aldclyffe looked at the steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You&mdash;know&mdash;something&mdash;of me?' she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know all,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then curse that wife of yours! She wrote and said she wouldn't tell you!'
      she burst out. 'Couldn't she keep her word for a day?' She reflected and
      then said, but no more as to a stranger, 'I will not yield. I have
      committed no crime. I yielded to her threats in a moment of weakness,
      though I felt inclined to defy her at the time: it was chiefly because I
      was mystified as to how she got to know of it. Pooh! I will put up with
      threats no more. O, can <i>you</i> threaten me?' she added softly, as if
      she had for the moment forgotten to whom she had been speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My love must be made your affair,' he repeated, without taking his eyes
      from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      An agony, which was not the agony of being discovered in a secret,
      obstructed her utterance for a time. 'How can you turn upon me so when I
      schemed to get you here&mdash;schemed that you might win her till I found
      you were married. O, how can you! O!... O!' She wept; and the weeping of
      such a nature was as harrowing as the weeping of a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your getting me here was bad policy as to your secret&mdash;the most
      absurd thing in the world,' he said, not heeding her distress. 'I knew
      all, except the identity of the individual, long ago. Directly I found
      that my coming here was a contrived thing, and not a matter of chance, it
      fixed my attention upon you at once. All that was required was the mere
      spark of life, to make of a bundle of perceptions an organic whole.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Policy, how can you talk of policy? Think, do think! And how can you
      threaten me when you know&mdash;you know&mdash;that I would befriend you
      readily without a threat!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes, I think you would,' he said more kindly; 'but your indifference
      for so many, many years has made me doubt it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, not indifference&mdash;'twas enforced silence. My father lived.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand, and held it gently.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      'Now listen,' he said, more quietly and humanly, when she had become
      calmer: 'Springrove must marry the woman he's engaged to. You may make
      him, but only in one way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well: but don't speak sternly, AEneas!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you know that his father has not been particularly thriving for the
      last two or three years?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have heard something of it, once or twice, though his rents have been
      promptly paid, haven't they?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes; and do you know the terms of the leases of the houses which are
      burnt?' he said, explaining to her that by those terms she might compel
      him even to rebuild every house. 'The case is the clearest case of fire by
      negligence that I have ever known, in addition to that,' he continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't want them rebuilt; you know it was intended by my father,
      directly they fell in, to clear the site for a new entrance to the park?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, but that doesn't affect the position, which is that Farmer
      Springrove is in your power to an extent which is very serious for him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I won't do it&mdash;'tis a conspiracy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Won't you for me?' he said eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe changed colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't threaten now, I implore,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because you might threaten if you chose,' she mournfully answered. 'But
      why be so&mdash;when your marriage with her was my own pet idea long
      before it was yours? What must I do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Scarcely anything: simply this. When I have seen old Mr. Springrove,
      which I shall do in a day or two, and told him that he will be expected to
      rebuild the houses, do you see the young man. See him yourself, in order
      that the proposals made may not appear to be anything more than an impulse
      of your own. You or he will bring up the subject of the houses. To rebuild
      them would be a matter of at least six hundred pounds, and he will almost
      surely say that we are hard in insisting upon the extreme letter of the
      leases. Then tell him that scarcely can you yourself think of compelling
      an old tenant like his father to any such painful extreme&mdash;there
      shall be no compulsion to build, simply a surrender of the leases. Then
      speak feelingly of his cousin, as a woman whom you respect and love, and
      whose secret you have learnt to be that she is heart-sick with hope
      deferred. Beg him to marry her, his betrothed and your friend, as some
      return for your consideration towards his father. Don't suggest too early
      a day for their marriage, or he will suspect you of some motive beyond
      womanly sympathy. Coax him to make a promise to her that she shall be his
      wife at the end of a twelvemonth, and get him, on assenting to this, to
      write to Cytherea, entirely renouncing her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She has already asked him to do that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So much the better&mdash;and telling her, too, that he is about to fulfil
      his long-standing promise to marry his cousin. If you think it worth
      while, you may say Cytherea was not indisposed to think of me before she
      knew I was married. I have at home a note she wrote me the first evening I
      saw her, which looks rather warm, and which I could show you. Trust me, he
      will give her up. When he is married to Adelaide Hinton, Cytherea will be
      induced to marry me&mdash;perhaps before; a woman's pride is soon
      wounded.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And hadn't I better write to Mr. Nyttleton, and inquire more particularly
      what's the law upon the houses?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no, there's no hurry for that. We know well enough how the case stands&mdash;quite
      well enough to talk in general terms about it. And I want the pressure to
      be put upon young Springrove before he goes away from home again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him furtively, long, and sadly, as after speaking he became
      lost in thought, his eyes listlessly tracing the pattern of the carpet.
      'Yes, yes, she will be mine,' he whispered, careless of Cytherea
      Aldclyffe's presence. At last he raised his eyes inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will do my best, AEneas,' she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Talibus incusat. Manston then left the house, and again went towards the
      blackened ruins, where men were still raking and probing.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. FROM NOVEMBER THE TWENTY-NINTH TO DECEMBER THE SECOND
    </p>
    <p>
      The smouldering remnants of the Three Tranters Inn seemed to promise that,
      even when the searchers should light upon the remains of the unfortunate
      Mrs. Manston, very little would be discoverable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consisting so largely of the charcoal and ashes of hard dry oak and
      chestnut, intermingled with thatch, the interior of the heap was one
      glowing mass of embers, which, on being stirred about, emitted sparks and
      flame long after it was dead and black on the outside. It was persistently
      hoped, however, that some traces of the body would survive the effect of
      the hot coals, and after a search pursued uninterruptedly for thirty
      hours, under the direction of Manston himself, enough was found to set at
      rest any doubts of her fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The melancholy gleanings consisted of her watch, bunch of keys, a few
      coins, and two charred and blackened bones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later the official inquiry into the cause of her death was held
      at the Rising Sun Inn, before Mr. Floy, the coroner, and a jury of the
      chief inhabitants of the district. The little tavern&mdash;the only
      remaining one in the village&mdash;was crowded to excess by the
      neighbouring peasantry as well as their richer employers: all who could by
      any possibility obtain an hour's release from their duties being present
      as listeners.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jury viewed the sad and infinitesimal remains, which were folded in a
      white cambric cloth, and laid in the middle of a well-finished coffin
      lined with white silk (by Manston's order), which stood in an adjoining
      room, the bulk of the coffin being completely filled in with carefully
      arranged flowers and evergreens&mdash;also the steward's own doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abraham Brown, of Hoxton, London&mdash;an old white-headed man, without
      the ruddiness which makes white hairs so pleasing&mdash;was sworn, and
      deposed that he kept a lodging-house at an address he named. On a Saturday
      evening less than a month before the fire, a lady came to him, with very
      little luggage, and took the front room on the second floor. He did not
      inquire where she came from, as she paid a week in advance, but she gave
      her name as Mrs. Manston, referring him, if he wished for any guarantee of
      her respectability, to Mr. Manston, Knapwater Park. Here she lived for
      three weeks, rarely going out. She slept away from her lodgings one night
      during the time. At the end of that time, on the twenty-eighth of
      November, she left his house in a four-wheeled cab, about twelve o'clock
      in the day, telling the driver to take her to the Waterloo Station. She
      paid all her lodging expenses, and not having given notice the full week
      previous to her going away, offered to pay for the next, but he only took
      half. She wore a thick black veil, and grey waterproof cloak, when she
      left him, and her luggage was two boxes, one of plain deal, with black
      japanned clamps, the other sewn up in canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph Chinney, porter at the Carriford Road Station, deposed that he saw
      Mrs. Manston, dressed as the last witness had described, get out of a
      second-class carriage on the night of the twenty-eighth. She stood beside
      him whilst her luggage was taken from the van. The luggage, consisting of
      the clamped deal box and another covered with canvas, was placed in the
      cloak-room. She seemed at a loss at finding nobody there to meet her. She
      asked him for some person to accompany her, and carry her bag to Mr.
      Manston's house, Knapwater Park. He was just off duty at that time, and
      offered to go himself. The witness here repeated the conversation he had
      had with Mrs. Manston during their walk, and testified to having left her
      at the door of the Three Tranters Inn, Mr. Manston's house being closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, Farmer Springrove was called. A murmur of surprise and commiseration
      passed round the crowded room when he stepped forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The events of the few preceding days had so worked upon his nervously
      thoughtful nature that the blue orbits of his eyes, and the mere spot of
      scarlet to which the ruddiness of his cheeks had contracted, seemed the
      result of a heavy sickness. A perfect silence pervaded the assembly when
      he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      His statement was that he received Mrs. Manston at the threshold, and
      asked her to enter the parlour. She would not do so, and stood in the
      passage whilst the maid went upstairs to see that the room was in order.
      The maid came down to the middle landing of the staircase, when Mrs.
      Manston followed her up to the room. He did not speak ten words with her
      altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, whilst he was standing at the door listening for his son
      Edward's return, he saw her light extinguished, having first caught sight
      of her shadow moving about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CORONER: 'Did her shadow appear to be that of a woman undressing?'
    </p>
    <p>
      SPRINGROVE: 'I cannot say, as I didn't take particular notice. It moved
      backwards and forwards; she might have been undressing or merely pacing up
      and down the room.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Fitler, the ostler's wife and chambermaid, said that she preceded
      Mrs. Manston into the room, put down the candle, and went out. Mrs.
      Manston scarcely spoke to her, except to ask her to bring a little brandy.
      Witness went and fetched it from the bar, brought it up, and put it on the
      dressing-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE CORONER: 'Had Mrs. Manston begun to undress, when you came back?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, sir; she was sitting on the bed, with everything on, as when she came
      in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did she begin to undress before you left?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not exactly before I had left; but when I had closed the door, and was on
      the landing I heard her boot drop on the floor, as it does sometimes when
      pulled off?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Had her face appeared worn and sleepy?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot say as her bonnet and veil were still on when I left, for she
      seemed rather shy and ashamed to be seen at the Three Tranters at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And did you hear or see any more of her?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No more, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Crickett, temporary servant to Mr. Manston, said that in accordance
      with Mr. Manston's orders, everything had been made comfortable in the
      house for Mrs. Manston's expected return on Monday night. Mr. Manston told
      her that himself and Mrs. Manston would be home late, not till between
      eleven and twelve o'clock, and that supper was to be ready. Not expecting
      Mrs. Manston so early, she had gone out on a very important errand to Mrs.
      Leat the postmistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Manston deposed that in looking down the columns of Bradshaw he had
      mistaken the time of the train's arrival, and hence was not at the station
      when she came. The broken watch produced was his wife's&mdash;he knew it
      by a scratch on the inner plate, and by other signs. The bunch of keys
      belonged to her: two of them fitted the locks of her two boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Flooks, agent to Lord Claydonfield at Chettlewood, said that Mr.
      Manston had pleaded as his excuse for leaving him rather early in the
      evening after their day's business had been settled, that he was going to
      meet his wife at Carriford Road Station, where she was coming by the last
      train that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surgeon said that the remains were those of a human being. The small
      fragment seemed a portion of one of the lumbar vertebrae&mdash;the other
      the head of the os femoris&mdash;but they were both so far gone that it
      was impossible to say definitely whether they belonged to the body of a
      male or female. There was no moral doubt that they were a woman's. He did
      not believe that death resulted from burning by fire. He thought she was
      crushed by the fall of the west gable, which being of wood, as well as the
      floor, burnt after it had fallen, and consumed the body with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three additional witnesses gave unimportant testimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coroner summed up, and the jury without hesitation found that the
      deceased Mrs. Manston came by her death accidentally through the burning
      of the Three Tranters Inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. DECEMBER THE SECOND. AFTERNOON
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Springrove came from the door of the Rising Sun at the end of the
      inquiry, Manston walked by his side as far as the stile to the park, a
      distance of about a stone's-throw.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, Mr. Springrove, this is a sad affair for everybody concerned.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Everybody,' said the old farmer, with deep sadness, ''tis quite a misery
      to me. I hardly know how I shall live through each day as it breaks. I
      think of the words, "In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were
      even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear
      of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes
      which thou shalt see."' His voice became broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah&mdash;true. I read Deuteronomy myself,' said Manston.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But my loss is as nothing to yours,' the farmer continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing; but I can commiserate you. I should be worse than unfeeling if I
      didn't, although my own affliction is of so sad and solemn a kind. Indeed
      my own loss makes me more keenly alive to yours, different in nature as it
      is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What sum do you think would be required of me to put the houses in place
      again?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have roughly thought six or seven hundred pounds.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If the letter of the law is to be acted up to,' said the old man, with
      more agitation in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, exactly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you know enough of Miss Aldclyffe's mind to give me an idea of how she
      means to treat me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I am afraid I must tell you that though I know very little of her
      mind as a rule, in this matter I believe she will be rather peremptory;
      she might share to the extent of a sixth or an eighth perhaps, in
      consideration of her getting new lamps for old, but I should hardly think
      more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The steward stepped upon the stile, and Mr. Springrove went along the road
      with a bowed head and heavy footsteps towards his niece's cottage, in
      which, rather against the wish of Edward, they had temporarily taken
      refuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The additional weight of this knowledge soon made itself perceptible.
      Though indoors with Edward or Adelaide nearly the whole of the afternoon,
      nothing more than monosyllabic replies could be drawn from him. Edward
      continually discovered him looking fixedly at the wall or floor, quite
      unconscious of another's presence. At supper he ate just as usual, but
      quite mechanically, and with the same abstraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. DECEMBER THE THIRD
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning he was in no better spirits. Afternoon came: his son was
      alarmed, and managed to draw from him an account of the conversation with
      the steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nonsense; he knows nothing about it,' said Edward vehemently. 'I'll see
      Miss Aldclyffe myself. Now promise me, father, that you'll not believe
      till I come back, and tell you to believe it, that Miss Aldclyffe will do
      any such unjust thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward started at once for Knapwater House. He strode rapidly along the
      high-road, till he reached a wicket where a footpath allowed of a short
      cut to the mansion. Here he leant down upon the bars for a few minutes,
      meditating as to the best manner of opening his speech, and surveying the
      scene before him in that absent mood which takes cognizance of little
      things without being conscious of them at the time, though they appear in
      the eye afterwards as vivid impressions. It was a yellow, lustrous, late
      autumn day, one of those days of the quarter when morning and evening seem
      to meet together without the intervention of a noon. The clear yellow
      sunlight had tempted forth Miss Aldclyffe herself, who was at this same
      time taking a walk in the direction of the village. As Springrove lingered
      he heard behind the plantation a woman's dress brushing along amid the
      prickly husks and leaves which had fallen into the path from the boughs of
      the chestnut trees. In another minute she stood in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered her casual greeting respectfully, and was about to request a
      few minutes' conversation with her, when she directly addressed him on the
      subject of the fire. 'It is a sad misfortune for your father' she said,
      'and I hear that he has lately let his insurances expire?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He has, madam, and you are probably aware that either by the general
      terms of his holding, or the same coupled with the origin of the fire, the
      disaster may involve the necessity of his rebuilding the whole row of
      houses, or else of becoming a debtor to the estate, to the extent of some
      hundreds of pounds?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She assented. 'I have been thinking of it,' she went on, and then repeated
      in substance the words put into her mouth by the steward. Some disturbance
      of thought might have been fancied as taking place in Springrove's mind
      during her statement, but before she had reached the end, his eyes were
      clear, and directed upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't accept your conditions of release,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They are not conditions exactly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, whatever they are not, they are very uncalled-for remarks.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not at all&mdash;the houses have been burnt by your family's negligence.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't refer to the houses&mdash;you have of course the best of all
      rights to speak of that matter; but you, a stranger to me comparatively,
      have no right at all to volunteer opinions and wishes upon a very delicate
      subject, which concerns no living beings but Miss Graye, Miss Hinton, and
      myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe, like a good many others in her position, had plainly not
      realized that a son of her tenant and inferior could have become an
      educated man, who had learnt to feel his individuality, to view society
      from a Bohemian standpoint, far outside the farming grade in Carriford
      parish, and that hence he had all a developed man's unorthodox opinion
      about the subordination of classes. And fully conscious of the labyrinth
      into which he had wandered between his wish to behave honourably in the
      dilemma of his engagement to his cousin Adelaide and the intensity of his
      love for Cytherea, Springrove was additionally sensitive to any allusion
      to the case. He had spoken to Miss Aldclyffe with considerable warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Miss Aldclyffe was not a woman likely to be far behind any second
      person in warming to a mood of defiance. It seemed as if she were prepared
      to put up with a cold refusal, but that her haughtiness resented a
      criticism of her conduct ending in a rebuke. By this, Manston's
      discreditable object, which had been made hers by compulsion only, was now
      adopted by choice. She flung herself into the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fiery man in such a case would have relinquished persuasion and tried
      palpable force. A fiery woman added unscrupulousness and evolved daring
      strategy; and in her obstinacy, and to sustain herself as mistress, she
      descended to an action the meanness of which haunted her conscience to her
      dying hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't quite see, Mr. Springrove,' she said, 'that I am altogether what
      you are pleased to call a stranger. I have known your family, at any rate,
      for a good many years, and I know Miss Graye particularly well, and her
      state of mind with regard to this matter.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Perplexed love makes us credulous and curious as old women. Edward was
      willing, he owned it to himself, to get at Cytherea's state of mind, even
      through so dangerous a medium.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A letter I received from her' he said, with assumed coldness, 'tells me
      clearly enough what Miss Graye's mind is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You think she still loves you? O yes, of course you do&mdash;all men are
      like that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have reason to.' He could feign no further than the first speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should be interested in knowing what reason?' she said, with sarcastic
      archness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward felt he was allowing her to do, in fractional parts, what he
      rebelled against when regarding it as a whole; but the fact that his
      antagonist had the presence of a queen, and features only in the early
      evening of their beauty, was not without its influence upon a keenly
      conscious man. Her bearing had charmed him into toleration, as Mary
      Stuart's charmed the indignant Puritan visitors. He again answered her
      honestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The best of reasons&mdash;the tone of her letter.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pooh, Mr. Springrove!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not at all, Miss Aldclyffe! Miss Graye desired that we should be
      strangers to each other for the simple practical reason that intimacy
      could only make wretched complications worse, not from lack of love&mdash;love
      is only suppressed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't you know yet, that in thus putting aside a man, a woman's pity for
      the pain she inflicts gives her a kindness of tone which is often mistaken
      for suppressed love?' said Miss Aldclyffe, with soft insidiousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a translation of the ambiguity of Cytherea's tone which he had
      certainly never thought of; and he was too ingenuous not to own it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I had never thought of it,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And don't believe it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not unless there was some other evidence to support the view.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused a minute and then began hesitatingly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'My intention was&mdash;what I did not dream of owning to you&mdash;my
      intention was to try to induce you to fulfil your promise to Miss Hinton
      not solely on her account and yours (though partly). I love Cytherea Graye
      with all my soul, and I want to see her happy even more than I do you. I
      did not mean to drag her name into the affair at all, but I am driven to
      say that she wrote that letter of dismissal to you&mdash;for it was a most
      pronounced dismissal&mdash;not on account of your engagement. She is old
      enough to know that engagements can be broken as easily as they can be
      made. She wrote it because she loved another man; very suddenly, and not
      with any idea or hope of marrying him, but none the less deeply.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Manston.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good&mdash;! I can't listen to you for an instant, madam; why, she hadn't
      seen him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She had; he came here the day before she wrote to you; and I could prove
      to you, if it were worth while, that on that day she went voluntarily to
      his house, though not artfully or blamably; stayed for two hours playing
      and singing; that no sooner did she leave him than she went straight home,
      and wrote the letter saying she should not see you again, entirely because
      she had seen him and fallen desperately in love with him&mdash;a perfectly
      natural thing for a young girl to do, considering that he's the handsomest
      man in the county. Why else should she not have written to you before?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because I was such a&mdash;because she did not know of the connection
      between me and my cousin until then.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I must think she did.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'On what ground?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'On the strong ground of my having told her so, distinctly, the very first
      day she came to live with me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, what do you seek to impress upon me after all? This&mdash;that the
      day Miss Graye wrote to me, saying it was better that we should part,
      coincided with the day she had seen a certain man&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A remarkably handsome and talented man.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I admit that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And that it coincided with the hour just subsequent to her seeing him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, just when she had seen him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And been to his house alone with him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is nothing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And stayed there playing and singing with him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Admit that, too,' he said; 'an accident might have caused it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And at the same instant that she wrote your dismissal she wrote a letter
      referring to a secret appointment with him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never, by God, madam! never!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do you say, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She sneered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's no accounting for beliefs, and the whole history is a very
      trivial matter; but I am resolved to prove that a lady's word is truthful,
      though upon a matter which concerns neither you nor herself. You shall
      learn that she <i>did</i> write him a letter concerning an assignation&mdash;that
      is, if Mr. Manston still has it, and will be considerate enough to lend it
      me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But besides,' continued Edward, 'a married man to do what would cause a
      young girl to write a note of the kind you mention!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She flushed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That I don't know anything about,' she stammered. 'But Cytherea didn't,
      of course, dream any more than I did, or others in the parish, that he was
      married.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course she didn't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I have reason to believe that he told her of the fact directly
      afterwards, that she might not compromise herself, or allow him to. It is
      notorious that he struggled honestly and hard against her attractions, and
      succeeded in hiding his feelings, if not in quenching them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We'll hope that he did.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But circumstances are changed now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very greatly changed,' he murmured abstractedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You must remember,' she added more suasively, 'that Miss Graye has a
      perfect right to do what she likes with her own&mdash;her heart, that is
      to say.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her descent from irritation was caused by perceiving that Edward's faith
      was really disturbed by her strong assertions, and it gratified her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward's thoughts flew to his father, and the object of his interview with
      her. Tongue-fencing was utterly distasteful to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will not trouble you by remaining longer, madam,' he remarked,
      gloomily; 'our conversation has ended sadly for me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't think so,' she said, 'and don't be mistaken. I am older than you
      are, many years older, and I know many things.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Full of miserable doubt, and bitterly regretting that he had raised his
      father's expectations by anticipations impossible of fulfilment, Edward
      slowly went his way into the village, and approached his cousin's house.
      The farmer was at the door looking eagerly for him. He had been waiting
      there for more than half-an-hour. His eye kindled quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, Ted, what does she say?' he asked, in the intensely sanguine tones
      which fall sadly upon a listener's ear, because, antecedently, they raise
      pictures of inevitable disappointment for the speaker, in some direction
      or another.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing for us to be alarmed at,' said Edward, with a forced
      cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But must we rebuild?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It seems we must, father.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man's eyes swept the horizon, then he turned to go in, without
      making another observation. All light seemed extinguished in him again.
      When Edward went in he found his father with the bureau open, unfolding
      the leases with a shaking hand, folding them up again without reading
      them, then putting them in their niche only to remove them again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adelaide was in the room. She said thoughtfully to Edward, as she watched
      the farmer&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I hope it won't kill poor uncle, Edward. What should we do if anything
      were to happen to him? He is the only near relative you and I have in the
      world.' It was perfectly true, and somehow Edward felt more bound up with
      her after that remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      She continued: 'And he was only saying so hopefully the day before the
      fire, that he wouldn't for the world let any one else give me away to you
      when we are married.'
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time a conscientious doubt arose in Edward's mind as to the
      justice of the course he was pursuing in resolving to refuse the
      alternative offered by Miss Aldclyffe. Could it be selfishness as well as
      independence? How much he had thought of his own heart, how little he had
      thought of his father's peace of mind!
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man did not speak again till supper-time, when he began asking his
      son an endless number of hypothetical questions on what might induce Miss
      Aldclyffe to listen to kinder terms; speaking of her now not as an unfair
      woman, but as a Lachesis or Fate whose course it behoved nobody to
      condemn. In his earnestness he once turned his eyes on Edward's face:
      their expression was woful: the pupils were dilated and strange in aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If she will only agree to that!' he reiterated for the hundredth time,
      increasing the sadness of his listeners.
    </p>
    <p>
      An aristocratic knocking came to the door, and Jane entered with a letter,
      addressed&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                'MR. EDWARD SPRINGROVE, Junior.'
</pre>
    <p>
      'Charles from Knapwater House brought it,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Aldclyffe's writing,' said Mr. Springrove, before Edward had
      recognized it himself. 'Now 'tis all right; she's going to make an offer;
      she doesn't want the houses there, not she; they are going to make that
      the way into the park.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward opened the seal and glanced at the inside. He said, with a supreme
      effort of self-command&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is only directed by Miss Aldclyffe, and refers to nothing connected
      with the fire. I wonder at her taking the trouble to send it to-night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      His father looked absently at him and turned away again. Shortly
      afterwards they retired for the night. Alone in his bedroom Edward opened
      and read what he had not dared to refer to in their presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The envelope contained another envelope in Cytherea's handwriting,
      addressed to '&mdash;&mdash; Manston, Esq., Old Manor House.' Inside this
      was the note she had written to the steward after her detention in his
      house by the thunderstorm&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                     'KNAPWATER HOUSE,
                          September 20th.
</pre>
    <p>
      'I find I cannot meet you at seven o'clock by the waterfall as I promised.
      The emotion I felt made me forgetful of realities. 'C. GRAYE.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe had not written a line, and, by the unvarying rule
      observable when words are not an absolute necessity, her silence seemed
      ten times as convincing as any expression of opinion could have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then, step by step, recalled all the conversation on the subject of
      Cytherea's feelings that had passed between himself and Miss Aldclyffe in
      the afternoon, and by a confusion of thought, natural enough under the
      trying experience, concluded that because the lady was truthful in her
      portraiture of effects, she must necessarily be right in her assumption of
      causes. That is, he was convinced that Cytherea&mdash;the
      hitherto-believed faithful Cytherea&mdash;had, at any rate, looked with
      something more than indifference upon the extremely handsome face and form
      of Manston.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did he blame her, as guilty of the impropriety of allowing herself to love
      the newcomer in the face of his not being free to return her love? No;
      never for a moment did he doubt that all had occurred in her old,
      innocent, impulsive way; that her heart was gone before she knew it&mdash;before
      she knew anything, beyond his existence, of the man to whom it had flown.
      Perhaps the very note enclosed to him was the result of first reflection.
      Manston he would unhesitatingly have called a scoundrel, but for one
      strikingly redeeming fact. It had been patent to the whole parish, and had
      come to Edward's own knowledge by that indirect channel, that Manston, as
      a married man, conscientiously avoided Cytherea after those first few days
      of his arrival during which her irresistibly beautiful and fatal glances
      had rested upon him&mdash;his upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking from his coat a creased and pocket-worn envelope containing
      Cytherea's letter to himself, Springrove opened it and read it through. He
      was upbraided therein, and he was dismissed. It bore the date of the
      letter sent to Manston, and by containing within it the phrase, 'All the
      day long I have been thinking,' afforded justifiable ground for assuming
      that it was written subsequently to the other (and in Edward's sight far
      sweeter one) to the steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though he accused her of fickleness, he would not doubt the
      genuineness, in its kind, of her partiality for him at Budmouth. It was a
      short and shallow feeling&mdash;not perfect love:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          'Love is not love
   Which alters when it alteration finds.'
</pre>
    <p>
      But it was not flirtation; a feeling had been born in her and had died. It
      would be well for his peace of mind if his love for her could flit away so
      softly, and leave so few traces behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe had shown herself desperately concerned in the whole matter
      by the alacrity with which she had obtained the letter from Manston, and
      her labours to induce himself to marry his cousin. Taken in connection
      with her apparent interest in, if not love for, Cytherea, her eagerness,
      too, could only be accounted for on the ground that Cytherea indeed loved
      the steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. DECEMBER THE FOURTH
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward passed the night he scarcely knew how, tossing feverishly from side
      to side, the blood throbbing in his temples, and singing in his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the day began to break he dressed himself. On going out upon the
      landing he found his father's bedroom door already open. Edward concluded
      that the old man had risen softly, as was his wont, and gone out into the
      fields to start the labourers. But neither of the outer doors was
      unfastened. He entered the front room, and found it empty. Then animated
      by a new idea, he went round to the little back parlour, in which the few
      wrecks saved from the fire were deposited, and looked in at the door.
      Here, near the window, the shutters of which had been opened half way, he
      saw his father leaning on the bureau, his elbows resting on the flap, his
      body nearly doubled, his hands clasping his forehead. Beside him were
      ghostly-looking square folds of parchment&mdash;the leases of the houses
      destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father looked up when Edward entered, and wearily spoke to the young
      man as his face came into the faint light.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Edward, why did you get up so early?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was uneasy, and could not sleep.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer turned again to the leases on the bureau, and seemed to become
      lost in reflection. In a minute or two, without lifting his eyes, he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'This is more than we can bear, Ted&mdash;more than we can bear! Ted, this
      will kill me. Not the loss only&mdash;the sense of my neglect about the
      insurance and everything. Borrow I never will. 'Tis all misery now. God
      help us&mdash;all misery now!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward did not answer, continuing to look fixedly at the dreary daylight
      outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ted,' the farmer went on, 'this upset of be-en burnt out o' home makes me
      very nervous and doubtful about everything. There's this troubles me
      besides&mdash;our liven here with your cousin, and fillen up her house. It
      must be very awkward for her. But she says she doesn't mind. Have you said
      anything to her lately about when you are going to marry her?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing at all lately.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, perhaps you may as well, now we are so mixed in together. You know,
      no time has ever been mentioned to her at all, first or last, and I think
      it right that now, since she has waited so patiently and so long&mdash;you
      are almost called upon to say you are ready. It would simplify matters
      very much, if you were to walk up to church wi' her one of these mornings,
      get the thing done, and go on liven here as we are. If you don't I must
      get a house all the sooner. It would lighten my mind, too, about the two
      little freeholds over the hill&mdash;not a morsel a-piece, divided as they
      were between her mother and me, but a tidy bit tied together again. Just
      think about it, will ye, Ted?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped from exhaustion produced by the intense concentration of his
      mind upon the weary subject, and looked anxiously at his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I will,' said Edward.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I am going to see her of the Great House this morning,' the farmer
      went on, his thoughts reverting to the old subject. 'I must know the
      rights of the matter, the when and the where. I don't like seeing her, but
      I'd rather talk to her than the steward. I wonder what she'll say to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger man knew exactly what she would say. If his father asked her
      what he was to do, and when, she would simply refer him to Manston: her
      character was not that of a woman who shrank from a proposition she had
      once laid down. If his father were to say to her that his son had at last
      resolved to marry his cousin within the year, and had given her a promise
      to that effect, she would say, 'Mr. Springrove, the houses are burnt:
      we'll let them go: trouble no more about them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind was already made up. He said calmly, 'Father, when you are
      talking to Miss Aldclyffe, mention to her that I have asked Adelaide if
      she is willing to marry me next Christmas. She is interested in my union
      with Adelaide, and the news will be welcome to her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And yet she can be iron with reference to me and her property,' the
      farmer murmured. 'Very well, Ted, I'll tell her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      6. DECEMBER THE FIFTH
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the many contradictory particulars constituting a woman's heart, two
      had shown their vigorous contrast in Cytherea's bosom just at this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a dark morning, the morning after old Mr. Springrove's visit to
      Miss Aldclyffe, which had terminated as Edward had intended. Having risen
      an hour earlier than was usual with her, Cytherea sat at the window of an
      elegant little sitting-room on the ground floor, which had been
      appropriated to her by the kindness or whim of Miss Aldclyffe, that she
      might not be driven into that lady's presence against her will. She leant
      with her face on her hand, looking out into the gloomy grey air. A yellow
      glimmer from the flapping flame of the newly-lit fire fluttered on one
      side of her face and neck like a butterfly about to settle there,
      contrasting warmly with the other side of the same fair face, which
      received from the window the faint cold morning light, so weak that her
      shadow from the fire had a distinct outline on the window-shutter in spite
      of it. There the shadow danced like a demon, blue and grim.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contradiction alluded to was that in spite of the decisive mood which
      two months earlier in the year had caused her to write a peremptory and
      final letter to Edward, she was now hoping for some answer other than the
      only possible one a man who, as she held, did not love her wildly, could
      send to such a communication. For a lover who did love wildly, she had
      left one little loophole in her otherwise straightforward epistle. Why she
      expected the letter on some morning of this particular week was, that
      hearing of his return to Carriford, she fondly assumed that he meant to
      ask for an interview before he left. Hence it was, too, that for the last
      few days, she had not been able to keep in bed later than the time of the
      postman's arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock pointed to half-past seven. She saw the postman emerge from
      beneath the bare boughs of the park trees, come through the wicket, dive
      through the shrubbery, reappear on the lawn, stalk across it without
      reference to paths&mdash;as country postmen do&mdash;and come to the
      porch. She heard him fling the bag down on the seat, and turn away towards
      the village, without hindering himself for a single pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the butler opened the door, took up the bag, brought it in, and
      carried it up the staircase to place it on the slab by Miss Aldclyffe's
      dressing-room door. The whole proceeding had been depicted by sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a presentiment that her letter was in the bag at last. She thought
      then in diminishing pulsations of confidence, 'He asks to see me! Perhaps
      he asks to see me: I hope he asks to see me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A quarter to eight: Miss Aldclyffe's bell&mdash;rather earlier than usual.
      'She must have heard the post-bag brought,' said the maiden, as, tired of
      the chilly prospect outside, she turned to the fire, and drew imaginative
      pictures of her future therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tap came to the door, and the lady's-maid entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Aldclyffe is awake,' she said; 'and she asked if you were moving
      yet, miss.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll run up to her,' said Cytherea, and flitted off with the utterance of
      the words. 'Very fortunate this,' she thought; 'I shall see what is in the
      bag this morning all the sooner.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She took it up from the side table, went into Miss Aldclyffe's bedroom,
      pulled up the blinds, and looked round upon the lady in bed, calculating
      the minutes that must elapse before she looked at her letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, darling, how are you? I am glad you have come in to see me,' said
      Miss Aldclyffe. 'You can unlock the bag this morning, child, if you like,'
      she continued, yawning factitiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Strange!' Cytherea thought; 'it seems as if she knew there was likely to
      be a letter for me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      From her bed Miss Aldclyffe watched the girl's face as she tremblingly
      opened the post-bag and found there an envelope addressed to her in
      Edward's handwriting; one he had written the day before, after the
      decision he had come to on an impartial, and on that account torturing,
      survey of his own, his father's, his cousin Adelaide's, and what he
      believed to be Cytherea's, position.
    </p>
    <p>
      The haughty mistress's soul sickened remorsefully within her when she saw
      suddenly appear upon the speaking countenance of the young lady before her
      a wan desolate look of agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master-sentences of Edward's letter were these: 'You speak truly. That
      we never meet again is the wisest and only proper course. That I regret
      the past as much as you do yourself, it is hardly necessary for me to
      say.'

    <h2>
      XII. THE EVENTS OF TEN MONTHS
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1. DECEMBER TO APRIL
    </h3>
    <p>
      Week after week, month after month, the time had flown by. Christmas had
      passed; dreary winter with dark evenings had given place to more dreary
      winter with light evenings. Thaws had ended in rain, rain in wind, wind in
      dust. Showery days had come&mdash;the period of pink dawns and white
      sunsets; with the third week in April the cuckoo had appeared, with the
      fourth, the nightingale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Springrove was in London, attending to the duties of his new
      office, and it had become known throughout the neighbourhood of Carriford
      that the engagement between himself and Miss Adelaide Hinton would
      terminate in marriage at the end of the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only occasion on which her lover of the idle delicious days at
      Budmouth watering-place had been seen by Cytherea after the time of the
      decisive correspondence, was once in church, when he sat in front of her,
      and beside Miss Hinton.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rencounter was quite an accident. Springrove had come there in the
      full belief that Cytherea was away from home with Miss Aldclyffe; and he
      continued ignorant of her presence throughout the service.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is at such moments as these, when a sensitive nature writhes under the
      conception that its most cherished emotions have been treated with
      contumely, that the sphere-descended Maid, Music, friend of Pleasure at
      other times, becomes a positive enemy&mdash;racking, bewildering,
      unrelenting. The congregation sang the first Psalm and came to the verse&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'Like some fair tree which, fed by streams,
       With timely fruit doth bend,
     He still shall flourish, and success
       All his designs attend.'
</pre>
    <p>
      Cytherea's lips did not move, nor did any sound escape her; but could she
      help singing the words in the depths of her being, although the man to
      whom she applied them sat at her rival's side?
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the moral compensation for all a woman's petty cleverness under
      thriving conditions is the real nobility that lies in her extreme
      foolishness at these other times; her sheer inability to be simply just,
      her exercise of an illogical power entirely denied to men in general&mdash;the
      power not only of kissing, but of delighting to kiss the rod by a
      punctilious observance of the self-immolating doctrines in the Sermon on
      the Mount.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Edward&mdash;a little like other men of his temperament, to whom,
      it is somewhat humiliating to think, the aberrancy of a given love is in
      itself a recommendation&mdash;his sentiment, as he looked over his
      cousin's book, was of a lower rank, Horatian rather than Psalmodic&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'O, what hast thou of her, of her
     Whose every look did love inspire;
     Whose every breathing fanned my fire,
     And stole me from myself away!'
</pre>
    <p>
      Then, without letting him see her, Cytherea slipt out of church early, and
      went home, the tones of the organ still lingering in her ears as she tried
      bravely to kill a jealous thought that would nevertheless live: 'My nature
      is one capable of more, far more, intense feeling than hers! She can't
      appreciate all the sides of him&mdash;she never will! He is more tangible
      to me even now, as a thought, than his presence itself is to her!' She was
      less noble then.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she continually repressed her misery and bitterness of heart till the
      effort to do so showed signs of lessening. At length she even tried to
      hope that her lost lover and her rival would love one another very dearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene and the sentiment dropped into the past. Meanwhile, Manston
      continued visibly before her. He, though quiet and subdued in his bearing
      for a long time after the calamity of November, had not simulated a grief
      that he did not feel. At first his loss seemed so to absorb him&mdash;though
      as a startling change rather than as a heavy sorrow&mdash;that he paid
      Cytherea no attention whatever. His conduct was uniformly kind and
      respectful, but little more. Then, as the date of the catastrophe grew
      remoter, he began to wear a different aspect towards her. He always
      contrived to obliterate by his manner all recollection on her side that
      she was comparatively more dependent than himself&mdash;making much of her
      womanhood, nothing of her situation. Prompt to aid her whenever occasion
      offered, and full of delightful petits soins at all times, he was not
      officious. In this way he irresistibly won for himself a position as her
      friend, and the more easily in that he allowed not the faintest symptom of
      the old love to be apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matters stood thus in the middle of the spring when the next move on his
      behalf was made by Miss Aldclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. THE THIRD OF MAY
    </p>
    <p>
      She led Cytherea to a summer-house called the Fane, built in the private
      grounds about the mansion in the form of a Grecian temple; it overlooked
      the lake, the island on it, the trees, and their undisturbed reflection in
      the smooth still water. Here the old and young maid halted; here they
      stood, side by side, mentally imbibing the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      The month was May&mdash;the time, morning. Cuckoos, thrushes, blackbirds,
      and sparrows gave forth a perfect confusion of song and twitter. The road
      was spotted white with the fallen leaves of apple-blossoms, and the
      sparkling grey dew still lingered on the grass and flowers. Two swans
      floated into view in front of the women, and then crossed the water
      towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They seem to come to us without any will of their own&mdash;quite
      involuntarily&mdash;don't they?' said Cytherea, looking at the birds'
      graceful advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, but if you look narrowly you can see their hips just beneath the
      water, working with the greatest energy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'd rather not see that, it spoils the idea of proud indifference to
      direction which we associate with a swan.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It does; we'll have "involuntarily." Ah, now this reminds me of
      something.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of what?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of a human being who involuntarily comes towards yourself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea looked into Miss Aldclyffe's face; her eyes grew round as
      circles, and lines of wonderment came visibly upon her countenance. She
      had not once regarded Manston as a lover since his wife's sudden
      appearance and subsequent death. The death of a wife, and such a death,
      was an overwhelming matter in her ideas of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is it a man or woman?' she said, quite innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Manston,' said Miss Aldclyffe quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Manston attracted by me <i>now</i>?' said Cytherea, standing at gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Didn't you know it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly I did not. Why, his poor wife has only been dead six months.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course he knows that. But loving is not done by months, or method, or
      rule, or nobody would ever have invented such a phrase as "falling in
      love." He does not want his love to be observed just yet, on the very
      account you mention; but conceal it as he may from himself and us, it
      exists definitely&mdash;and very intensely, I assure you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose then, that if he can't help it, it is no harm of him,' said
      Cytherea naively, and beginning to ponder.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course it isn't&mdash;you know that well enough. She was a great
      burden and trouble to him. This may become a great good to you both.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A rush of feeling at remembering that the same woman, before Manston's
      arrival, had just as frankly advocated Edward's claims, checked Cytherea's
      utterance for awhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There, don't look at me like that, for Heaven's sake!' said Miss
      Aldclyffe. 'You could almost kill a person by the force of reproach you
      can put into those eyes of yours, I verily believe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward once in the young lady's thoughts, there was no getting rid of him.
      She wanted to be alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you want me here?' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now there, there; you want to be off, and have a good cry,' said Miss
      Aldclyffe, taking her hand. 'But you mustn't, my dear. There's nothing in
      the past for you to regret. Compare Mr. Manston's honourable conduct
      towards his wife and yourself, with Springrove towards his betrothed and
      yourself, and then see which appears the more worthy of your thoughts.'
    </p>
    <p>
      3. FROM THE FOURTH OF MAY TO THE TWENTY-FIRST OF JUNE
    </p>
    <p>
      The next stage in Manston's advances towards her hand was a clearly
      defined courtship. She was sadly perplexed, and some contrivance was
      necessary on his part in order to meet with her. But it is next to
      impossible for an appreciative woman to have a positive repugnance towards
      an unusually handsome and gifted man, even though she may not be inclined
      to love him. Hence Cytherea was not so alarmed at the sight of him as to
      render a meeting and conversation with her more than a matter of
      difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming and going from church was his grand opportunity. Manston was very
      religious now. It is commonly said that no man was ever converted by
      argument, but there is a single one which will make any Laodicean in
      England, let him be once love-sick, wear prayer-books and become a zealous
      Episcopalian&mdash;the argument that his sweetheart can be seen from his
      pew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston introduced into his method a system of bewitching flattery,
      everywhere pervasive, yet, too, so transitory and intangible, that, as in
      the case of the poet Wordsworth and the Wandering Voice, though she felt
      it present, she could never find it. As a foil to heighten its effect, he
      occasionally spoke philosophically of the evanescence of female beauty&mdash;the
      worthlessness of mere appearance. 'Handsome is that handsome does' he
      considered a proverb which should be written on the looking-glass of every
      woman in the land. 'Your form, your motions, your heart have won me,' he
      said, in a tone of playful sadness. 'They are beautiful. But I see these
      things, and it comes into my mind that they are doomed, they are gliding
      to nothing as I look. Poor eyes, poor mouth, poor face, poor maiden!
      "Where will her glories be in twenty years?" I say. "Where will all of her
      be in a hundred?" Then I think it is cruel that you should bloom a day,
      and fade for ever and ever. It seems hard and sad that you will die as
      ordinarily as I, and be buried; be food for roots and worms, be forgotten
      and come to earth, and grow up a mere blade of churchyard-grass and an ivy
      leaf. Then, Miss Graye, when I see you are a Lovely Nothing, I pity you,
      and the love I feel then is better and sounder, larger and more lasting
      than that I felt at the beginning.' Again an ardent flash of his handsome
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was by this route that he ventured on an indirect declaration and offer
      of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She implied in the same indirect manner that she did not love him enough
      to accept it.
    </p>
    <p>
      An actual refusal was more than he had expected. Cursing himself for what
      he called his egregious folly in making himself the slave of a mere lady's
      attendant, and for having given the parish, should they know of her
      refusal, a chance of sneering at him&mdash;certainly a ground for thinking
      less of his standing than before&mdash;he went home to the Old House, and
      walked indecisively up and down his back-yard. Turning aside, he leant his
      arms upon the edge of the rain-water-butt standing in the corner, and
      looked into it. The reflection from the smooth stagnant surface tinged his
      face with the greenish shades of Correggio's nudes. Staves of sunlight
      slanted down through the still pool, lighting it up with wonderful
      distinctness. Hundreds of thousands of minute living creatures sported and
      tumbled in its depth with every contortion that gaiety could suggest;
      perfectly happy, though consisting only of a head, or a tail, or at most a
      head and a tail, and all doomed to die within the twenty-four hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Damn my position! Why shouldn't I be happy through my little day too? Let
      the parish sneer at my repulses, let it. I'll get her, if I move heaven
      and earth to do it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, the inexperienced Cytherea had, towards Edward in the first place,
      and Manston afterwards, unconsciously adopted bearings that would have
      been the very tactics of a professional fisher of men who wished to have
      them each successively dangling at her heels. For if any rule at all can
      be laid down in a matter which, for men collectively, is notoriously
      beyond regulation, it is that to snub a petted man, and to pet a snubbed
      man, is the way to win in suits of both kinds. Manston with Springrove's
      encouragement would have become indifferent. Edward with Manston's
      repulses would have sheered off at the outset, as he did afterwards. Her
      supreme indifference added fuel to Manston's ardour&mdash;it completely
      disarmed his pride. The invulnerable Nobody seemed greater to him than a
      susceptible Princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. FROM THE TWENTY-FIRST OF JUNE TO THE END OF JULY
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea had in the meantime received the following letter from her
      brother. It was the first definite notification of the enlargement of that
      cloud no bigger than a man's hand which had for nearly a twelvemonth hung
      before them in the distance, and which was soon to give a colour to their
      whole sky from horizon to horizon.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                               'BUDMOUTH REGIS,
</pre>
    <p>
      Saturday.
    </p>
    <p>
      'DARLING SIS,&mdash;I have delayed telling you for a long time of a little
      matter which, though not one to be seriously alarmed about, is
      sufficiently vexing, and it would be unfair in me to keep it from you any
      longer. It is that for some time past I have again been distressed by that
      lameness which I first distinctly felt when we went to Lulstead Cove, and
      again when I left Knapwater that morning early. It is an unusual pain in
      my left leg, between the knee and the ankle. I had just found fresh
      symptoms of it when you were here for that half-hour about a month ago&mdash;when
      you said in fun that I began to move like an old man. I had a good mind to
      tell you then, but fancying it would go off in a few days, I thought it
      was not worth while. Since that time it has increased, but I am still able
      to work in the office, sitting on the stool. My great fear is that Mr. G.
      will have some out-door measuring work for me to do soon, and that I shall
      be obliged to decline it. However, we will hope for the best. How it came,
      what was its origin, or what it tends to, I cannot think. You shall hear
      again in a day or two, if it is no better...&mdash;Your loving brother,
      OWEN.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This she answered, begging to know the worst, which she could bear, but
      suspense and anxiety never. In two days came another letter from him, of
      which the subjoined paragraph is a portion:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I had quite decided to let you know the worst, and to assure you that it
      was the worst, before you wrote to ask it. And again I give you my word
      that I will conceal nothing&mdash;so that there will be no excuse whatever
      for your wearing yourself out with fears that I am worse than I say. This
      morning then, for the first time, I have been obliged to stay away from
      the office. Don't be frightened at this, dear Cytherea. Rest is all that
      is wanted, and by nursing myself now for a week, I may avoid an illness of
      six months.'
    </p>
    <p>
      After a visit from her he wrote again:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dr. Chestman has seen me. He said that the ailment was some sort of
      rheumatism, and I am now undergoing proper treatment for its cure. My leg
      and foot have been placed in hot bran, liniments have been applied, and
      also severe friction with a pad. He says I shall be as right as ever in a
      very short time. Directly I am I shall run up by the train to see you.
      Don't trouble to come to me if Miss Aldclyffe grumbles again about your
      being away, for I am going on capitally.... You shall hear again at the
      end of the week.'
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time mentioned came the following:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am sorry to tell you, because I know it will be so disheartening after
      my last letter, that I am not so well as I was then, and that there has
      been a sort of hitch in the proceedings. After I had been treated for
      rheumatism a few days longer (in which treatment they pricked the place
      with a long needle several times,) I saw that Dr. Chestman was in doubt
      about something, and I requested that he would call in a brother
      professional man to see me as well. They consulted together and then told
      me that rheumatism was not the disease after all, but erysipelas. They
      then began treating it differently, as became a different matter.
      Blisters, flour, and starch, seem to be the order of the day now&mdash;medicine,
      of course, besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Gradfield has been in to inquire about me. He says he has been
      obliged to get a designer in my place, which grieves me very much, though,
      of course, it could not be avoided.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A month passed away; throughout this period, Cytherea visited him as often
      as the limited time at her command would allow, and wore as cheerful a
      countenance as the womanly determination to do nothing which might depress
      him could enable her to wear. Another letter from him then told her these
      additional facts:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'The doctors find they are again on the wrong tack. They cannot make out
      what the disease is. O Cytherea! how I wish they knew! This suspense is
      wearing me out. Could not Miss Aldclyffe spare you for a day? Do come to
      me. We will talk about the best course then. I am sorry to complain, but I
      am worn out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea went to Miss Aldclyffe, and told her of the melancholy turn her
      brother's illness had taken. Miss Aldclyffe at once said that Cytherea
      might go, and offered to do anything to assist her which lay in her power.
      Cytherea's eyes beamed gratitude as she turned to leave the room, and
      hasten to the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, Cytherea,' said Miss Aldclyffe, calling her back; 'just one word. Has
      Mr. Manston spoken to you lately?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said Cytherea, blushing timorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He proposed?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you refused him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tut, tut! Now listen to my advice,' said Miss Aldclyffe emphatically,
      'and accept him before he changes his mind. The chance which he offers you
      of settling in life is one that may possibly, probably, not occur again.
      His position is good and secure, and the life of his wife would be a happy
      one. You may not be sure that you love him madly; but suppose you are not
      sure? My father used to say to me as a child when he was teaching me
      whist, "When in doubt win the trick!" That advice is ten times as valuable
      to a woman on the subject of matrimony. In refusing a man there is always
      the risk that you may never get another offer.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why didn't you win the trick when you were a girl?' said Cytherea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come, my lady Pert; I'm not the text,' said Miss Aldclyffe, her face
      glowing like fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea laughed stealthily.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was about to say,' resumed Miss Aldclyffe severely, 'that here is Mr.
      Manston waiting with the tenderest solicitude for you, and you overlooking
      it, as if it were altogether beneath you. Think how you might benefit your
      sick brother if you were Mrs. Manston. You will please me <i>very much</i>
      by giving him some encouragement. You understand me, Cythie dear?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And,' said Miss Aldclyffe, still more emphatically, 'on your promising
      that you will accept him some time this year, I will take especial care of
      your brother. You are listening, Cytherea?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' she whispered, leaving the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to Budmouth, passed the day with her brother, and returned to
      Knapwater wretched and full of foreboding. Owen had looked startlingly
      thin and pale&mdash;thinner and paler than ever she had seen him before.
      The brother and sister had that day decided that notwithstanding the drain
      upon their slender resources, another surgeon should see him. Time was
      everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen told her the result in his next letter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'The three practitioners between them have at last hit the nail on the
      head, I hope. They probed the place, and discovered that the secret lay in
      the bone. I underwent an operation for its removal three days ago (after
      taking chloroform)... Thank God it is over. Though I am so weak, my
      spirits are rather better. I wonder when I shall be at work again? I asked
      the surgeons how long it would be first. I said a month? They shook their
      heads. A year? I said. Not so long, they said. Six months? I inquired.
      They would not, or could not, tell me. But never mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Run down, when you have half a day to spare, for the hours drag on so
      drearily. O Cytherea, you can't think how drearily!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She went. Immediately on her departure Miss Aldclyffe sent a note to the
      Old House, to Manston. On the maiden's return, tired and sick at heart as
      usual, she found Manston at the station awaiting her. He asked politely if
      he might accompany her to Knapwater. She tacitly acquiesced. During their
      walk he inquired the particulars of her brother's illness, and with an
      irresistible desire to pour out her trouble to some one, she told him of
      the length of time which must elapse before he could be strong again, and
      of the lack of comfort in lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston was silent awhile. Then he said impetuously: 'Miss Graye, I will
      not mince matters&mdash;I love you&mdash;you know it. Stratagem they say
      is fair in love, and I am compelled to adopt it now. Forgive me, for I
      cannot help it. Consent to be my wife at any time that may suit you&mdash;any
      remote day you may name will satisfy me&mdash;and you shall find him well
      provided for.'
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time in her life she truly dreaded the handsome man at her
      side who pleaded thus selfishly, and shrank from the hot voluptuous nature
      of his passion for her, which, disguise it as he might under a quiet and
      polished exterior, at times radiated forth with a scorching white heat.
      She perceived how animal was the love which bargained.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do not love you, Mr. Manston,' she replied coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. FROM THE FIRST TO THE TWENTY-SEVENTH OF AUGUST
    </p>
    <p>
      The long sunny days of the later summer-time brought only the same dreary
      accounts from Budmouth, and saw Cytherea paying the same sad visits.
    </p>
    <p>
      She grew perceptibly weaker, in body and mind. Manston still persisted in
      his suit, but with more of his former indirectness, now that he saw how
      unexpectedly well she stood an open attack. His was the system of Dares at
      the Sicilian games&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'He, like a captain who beleaguers round
      Some strong-built castle on a rising ground,
      Views all the approaches with observing eyes,
      This and that other part again he tries,
      And more on industry than force relies.'
</pre>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe made it appear more clearly than ever that aid to Owen from
      herself depended entirely upon Cytherea's acceptance of her steward.
      Hemmed in and distressed, Cytherea's answers to his importunities grew
      less uniform; they were firm, or wavering, as Owen's malady fluctuated.
      Had a register of her pitiful oscillations been kept, it would have
      rivalled in pathos the diary wherein De Quincey tabulates his combat with
      Opium&mdash;perhaps as noticeable an instance as any in which a thrilling
      dramatic power has been given to mere numerals. Thus she wearily and
      monotonously lived through the month, listening on Sundays to the
      well-known round of chapters narrating the history of Elijah and Elisha in
      famine and drought; on week-days to buzzing flies in hot sunny rooms. 'So
      like, so very like, was day to day.' Extreme lassitude seemed all that the
      world could show her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her state was in this wise, when one afternoon, having been with her
      brother, she met the surgeon, and begged him to tell the actual truth
      concerning Owen's condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reply was that he feared that the first operation had not been
      thorough; that although the wound had healed, another attempt might still
      be necessary, unless nature were left to effect her own cure. But the time
      such a self-healing proceeding would occupy might be ruinous.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How long would it be?' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is impossible to say. A year or two, more or less.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And suppose he submitted to another artificial extraction?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then he might be well in four or six months.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the remainder of his and her possessions, together with a sum he had
      borrowed, would not provide him with necessary comforts for half that
      time. To combat the misfortune, there were two courses open&mdash;her
      becoming betrothed to Manston, or the sending Owen to the County Hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus terrified, driven into a corner, panting and fluttering about for
      some loophole of escape, yet still shrinking from the idea of being
      Manston's wife, the poor little bird endeavoured to find out from Miss
      Aldclyffe whether it was likely Owen would be well treated in the
      hospital.
    </p>
    <p>
      'County Hospital!' said Miss Aldclyffe; 'why, it is only another name for
      slaughter-house&mdash;in surgical cases at any rate. Certainly if anything
      about your body is snapt in two they do join you together in a fashion,
      but 'tis so askew and ugly, that you may as well be apart again.' Then she
      terrified the inquiring and anxious maiden by relating horrid stories of
      how the legs and arms of poor people were cut off at a moment's notice,
      especially in cases where the restorative treatment was likely to be long
      and tedious.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You know how willing I am to help you, Cytherea,' she added
      reproachfully. 'You know it. Why are you so obstinate then? Why do you
      selfishly bar the clear, honourable, and only sisterly path which leads
      out of this difficulty? I cannot, on my conscience, countenance you; no, I
      cannot.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston once more repeated his offer; and once more she refused, but this
      time weakly, and with signs of an internal struggle. Manston's eye
      sparkled; he saw for the hundredth time in his life, that perseverance, if
      only systematic, was irresistible by womankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. THE TWENTY-SEVENTH OF AUGUST
    </p>
    <p>
      On going to Budmouth three days later, she found to her surprise that the
      steward had been there, had introduced himself, and had seen her brother.
      A few delicacies had been brought him also by the same hand. Owen spoke in
      warm terms of Manston and his free and unceremonious call, as he could not
      have refrained from doing of any person, of any kind, whose presence had
      served to help away the tedious hours of a long day, and who had,
      moreover, shown that sort of consideration for him which the accompanying
      basket implied&mdash;antecedent consideration, so telling upon all
      invalids&mdash;and which he so seldom experienced except from the hands of
      his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      How should he perceive, amid this tithe-paying of mint, and anise, and
      cummin, the weightier matters which were left undone?
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the steward met her at Carriford Road Station on her return journey.
      Instead of being frigid as at the former meeting at the same place, she
      was embarrassed by a strife of thought, and murmured brokenly her thanks
      for what he had done. The same request that he might see her home was
      made.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had perceived his error in making his kindness to Owen a conditional
      kindness, and had hastened to efface all recollection of it. 'Though I let
      my offer on her brother's&mdash;my friend's&mdash;behalf, seem dependent
      on my lady's graciousness to me,' he whispered wooingly in the course of
      their walk, 'I could not conscientiously adhere to my statement; it was
      said with all the impulsive selfishness of love. Whether you choose to
      have me, or whether you don't, I love you too devotedly to be anything but
      kind to your brother.... Miss Graye, Cytherea, I will do anything,' he
      continued earnestly, 'to give you pleasure&mdash;indeed I will.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw on the one hand her poor and much-loved Owen recovering from his
      illness and troubles by the disinterested kindness of the man beside her,
      on the other she drew him dying, wholly by reason of her self-enforced
      poverty. To marry this man was obviously the course of common sense, to
      refuse him was impolitic temerity. There was reason in this. But there was
      more behind than a hundred reasons&mdash;a woman's gratitude and her
      impulse to be kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wavering of her mind was visible in her tell-tale face. He noticed it,
      and caught at the opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were standing by the ruinous foundations of an old mill in the midst
      of a meadow. Between grey and half-overgrown stonework&mdash;the only
      signs of masonry remaining&mdash;the water gurgled down from the old
      millpond to a lower level, under the cloak of rank broad leaves&mdash;the
      sensuous natures of the vegetable world. On the right hand the sun,
      resting on the horizon-line, streamed across the ground from below
      copper-coloured and lilac clouds, stretched out in flats beneath a sky of
      pale soft green. All dark objects on the earth that lay towards the sun
      were overspread by a purple haze, against which a swarm of wailing gnats
      shone forth luminously, rising upward and floating away like sparks of
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stillness oppressed and reduced her to mere passivity. The only wish
      the humidity of the place left in her was to stand motionless. The
      helpless flatness of the landscape gave her, as it gives all such
      temperaments, a sense of bare equality with, and no superiority to, a
      single entity under the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came so close that their clothes touched. 'Will you try to love me? Do
      try to love me!' he said, in a whisper, taking her hand. He had never
      taken it before. She could feel his hand trembling exceedingly as it held
      hers in its clasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering his kindness to her brother, his love for herself, and
      Edward's fickleness, ought she to forbid him to do this? How truly pitiful
      it was to feel his hand tremble so&mdash;all for her! Should she withdraw
      her hand? She would think whether she would. Thinking, and hesitating, she
      looked as far as the autumnal haze on the marshy ground would allow her to
      see distinctly. There was the fragment of a hedge&mdash;all that remained
      of a 'wet old garden'&mdash;standing in the middle of the mead, without a
      definite beginning or ending, purposeless and valueless. It was overgrown,
      and choked with mandrakes, and she could almost fancy she heard their
      shrieks.... Should she withdraw her hand? No, she could not withdraw it
      now; it was too late, the act would not imply refusal. She felt as one in
      a boat without oars, drifting with closed eyes down a river&mdash;she knew
      not whither.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave her hand a gentle pressure, and relinquished it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it seemed as if he were coming to the point again. No, he was not
      going to urge his suit that evening. Another respite.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. THE EARLY PART OF SEPTEMBER
    </p>
    <p>
      Saturday came, and she went on some trivial errand to the village
      post-office. It was a little grey cottage with a luxuriant jasmine
      encircling the doorway, and before going in Cytherea paused to admire this
      pleasing feature of the exterior. Hearing a step on the gravel behind the
      corner of the house, she resigned the jasmine and entered. Nobody was in
      the room. She could hear Mrs. Leat, the widow who acted as postmistress,
      walking about over her head. Cytherea was going to the foot of the stairs
      to call Mrs. Leat, but before she had accomplished her object, another
      form stood at the half-open door. Manston came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Both on the same errand,' he said gracefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will call her,' said Cytherea, moving in haste to the foot of the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'One moment.' He glided to her side. 'Don't call her for a moment,' he
      repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had said, 'Mrs. Leat!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He seized Cytherea's hand, kissed it tenderly, and carefully replaced it
      by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had that morning determined to check his further advances, until she
      had thoroughly considered her position. The remonstrance was now on her
      tongue, but as accident would have it, before the word could be spoken
      Mrs. Leat was stepping from the last stair to the floor, and no
      remonstrance came.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the subtlety which characterized him in all his dealings with her, he
      quickly concluded his own errand, bade her a good-bye, in the tones of
      which love was so garnished with pure politeness that it only showed its
      presence to herself, and left the house&mdash;putting it out of her power
      to refuse him her companionship homeward, or to object to his late action
      of kissing her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Friday of the next week brought another letter from her brother. In
      this he informed her that, in absolute grief lest he should distress her
      unnecessarily, he had some time earlier borrowed a few pounds. A week ago,
      he said, his creditor became importunate, but that on the day on which he
      wrote, the creditor had told him there was no hurry for a settlement, that
      'his <i>sister's suitor</i> had guaranteed the sum.' 'Is he Mr. Manston?
      tell me, Cytherea,' said Owen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He also mentioned that a wheeled chair had been anonymously hired for his
      especial use, though as yet he was hardly far enough advanced towards
      convalescence to avail himself of the luxury. 'Is this Mr. Manston's
      doing?' he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could dally with her perplexity, evade it, trust to time for guidance,
      no longer. The matter had come to a crisis: she must once and for all
      choose between the dictates of her understanding and those of her heart.
      She longed, till her soul seemed nigh to bursting, for her lost mother's
      return to earth, but for one minute, that she might have tender counsel to
      guide her through this, her great difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for her heart, she half fancied that it was not Edward's to quite the
      extent that it once had been; she thought him cruel in conducting himself
      towards her as he did at Budmouth, cruel afterwards in making so light of
      her. She knew he had stifled his love for her&mdash;was utterly lost to
      her. But for all that she could not help indulging in a woman's pleasure
      of recreating defunct agonies, and lacerating herself with them now and
      then.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If I were rich,' she thought, 'I would give way to the luxury of being
      morbidly faithful to him for ever without his knowledge.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But she considered; in the first place she was a homeless dependent; and
      what did practical wisdom tell her to do under such desperate
      circumstances? To provide herself with some place of refuge from poverty,
      and with means to aid her brother Owen. This was to be Mr. Manston's wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not love him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what was love without a home? Misery. What was a home without love?
      Alas, not much; but still a kind of home.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' she thought, 'I am urged by my common sense to marry Mr. Manston.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Did anything nobler in her say so too?
    </p>
    <p>
      With the death (to her) of Edward her heart's occupation was gone. Was it
      necessary or even right for her to tend it and take care of it as she used
      to in the old time, when it was still a capable minister?
    </p>
    <p>
      By a slight sacrifice here she could give happiness to at least two hearts
      whose emotional activities were still unwounded. She would do good to two
      men whose lives were far more important than hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' she said again, 'even Christianity urges me to marry Mr. Manston.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Directly Cytherea had persuaded herself that a kind of heroic
      self-abnegation had to do with the matter, she became much more content in
      the consideration of it. A wilful indifference to the future was what
      really prevailed in her, ill and worn out, as she was, by the perpetual
      harassments of her sad fortune, and she regarded this indifference, as
      gushing natures will do under such circumstances, as genuine resignation
      and devotedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston met her again the following day: indeed, there was no escaping him
      now. At the end of a short conversation between them, which took place in
      the hollow of the park by the waterfall, obscured on the outer side by the
      low hanging branches of the limes, she tacitly assented to his assumption
      of a privilege greater than any that had preceded it. He stooped and
      kissed her brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before going to bed she wrote to Owen explaining the whole matter. It was
      too late in the evening for the postman's visit, and she placed the letter
      on the mantelpiece to send it the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning (Sunday) brought a hurried postscript to Owen's letter of the
      day before:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                              'September 9, 1865.
</pre>
    <p>
      'DEAR CYTHEREA&mdash;I have received a frank and friendly letter from Mr.
      Manston explaining the position in which he stands now, and also that in
      which he hopes to stand towards you. Can't you love him? Why not? Try, for
      he is a good, and not only that, but a cultured man. Think of the weary
      and laborious future that awaits you if you continue for life in your
      present position, and do you see any way of escape from it except by
      marriage? I don't. Don't go against your heart, Cytherea, but be wise.&mdash;Ever
      affectionately yours, OWEN.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought that probably he had replied to Mr. Manston in the same
      favouring mood. She had a conviction that that day would settle her doom.
      Yet
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'So true a fool is love,'
</pre>
    <p>
      that even now she nourished a half-hope that something would happen at the
      last moment to thwart her deliberately-formed intentions, and favour the
      old emotion she was using all her strength to thrust down.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. THE TENTH OF SEPTEMBER
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sunday was the thirteenth after Trinity, and the afternoon service at
      Carriford was nearly over. The people were singing the Evening Hymn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston was at church as usual in his accustomed place two seats forward
      from the large square pew occupied by Miss Aldclyffe and Cytherea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ordinary sadness of an autumnal evening-service seemed, in Cytherea's
      eyes, to be doubled on this particular occasion. She looked at all the
      people as they stood and sang, waving backwards and forwards like a forest
      of pines swayed by a gentle breeze; then at the village children singing
      too, their heads inclined to one side, their eyes listlessly tracing some
      crack in the old walls, or following the movement of a distant bough or
      bird with features petrified almost to painfulness. Then she looked at
      Manston; he was already regarding her with some purpose in his glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is coming this evening,' she said in her mind. A minute later, at the
      end of the hymn, when the congregation began to move out, Manston came
      down the aisle. He was opposite the end of her seat as she stepped from
      it, the remainder of their progress to the door being in contact with each
      other. Miss Aldclyffe had lingered behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't let's hurry,' he said, when Cytherea was about to enter the private
      path to the House as usual. 'Would you mind turning down this way for a
      minute till Miss Aldclyffe has passed?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not very well refuse now. They turned into a secluded path on
      their left, leading round through a thicket of laurels to the other gate
      of the church-yard, walking very slowly. By the time the further gate was
      reached, the church was closed. They met the sexton with the keys in his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We are going inside for a minute,' said Manston to him, taking the keys
      unceremoniously. 'I will bring them to you when we return.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The sexton nodded his assent, and Cytherea and Manston walked into the
      porch, and up the nave.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not speak a word during their progress, or in any way interfere
      with the stillness and silence that prevailed everywhere around them.
      Everything in the place was the embodiment of decay: the fading red glare
      from the setting sun, which came in at the west window, emphasizing the
      end of the day and all its cheerful doings, the mildewed walls, the uneven
      paving-stones, the wormy pews, the sense of recent occupation, and the
      dank air of death which had gathered with the evening, would have made
      grave a lighter mood than Cytherea's was then.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What sensations does the place impress you with?' she said at last, very
      sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I feel imperatively called upon to be honest, from very despair of
      achieving anything by stratagem in a world where the materials are such as
      these.' He, too, spoke in a depressed voice, purposely or otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I feel as if I were almost ashamed to be seen walking such a world,' she
      murmured; 'that's the effect it has upon me; but it does not induce me to
      be honest particularly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand in both his, and looked down upon the lids of her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I pity you sometimes,' he said more emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am pitiable, perhaps; so are many people. Why do you pity me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think that you make yourself needlessly sad.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not needlessly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, needlessly. Why should you be separated from your brother so much,
      when you might have him to stay with you till he is well?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That can't be,' she said, turning away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on, 'I think the real and only good thing that can be done for him
      is to get him away from Budmouth awhile; and I have been wondering whether
      it could not be managed for him to come to my house to live for a few
      weeks. Only a quarter of a mile from you. How pleasant it would be!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It would.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved himself round immediately to the front of her, and held her hand
      more firmly, as he continued, 'Cytherea, why do you say "It would," so
      entirely in the tone of abstract supposition? I want him there: I want him
      to be my brother, too. Then make him so, and be my wife! I cannot live
      without you. O Cytherea, my darling, my love, come and be my wife!'
    </p>
    <p>
      His face bent closer and closer to hers, and the last words sank to a
      whisper as weak as the emotion inspiring it was strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said firmly and distinctly, 'Yes, I will.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Next month?' he said on the instant, before taking breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No; not next month.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The next?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'December? Christmas Day, say?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't mind.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, you darling!' He was about to imprint a kiss upon her pale, cold
      mouth, but she hastily covered it with her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't kiss me&mdash;at least where we are now!' she whispered
      imploringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We are too near God.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a sudden start, and his face flushed. She had spoken so
      emphatically that the words 'Near God' echoed back again through the
      hollow building from the far end of the chancel.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a thing to say!' he exclaimed; 'surely a pure kiss is not
      inappropriate to the place!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' she replied, with a swelling heart; 'I don't know why I burst out so&mdash;I
      can't tell what has come over me! Will you forgive me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How shall I say "Yes" without judging you? How shall I say "No" without
      losing the pleasure of saying "Yes?"' He was himself again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know,' she absently murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll say "Yes,"' he answered daintily. 'It is sweeter to fancy we are
      forgiven, than to think we have not sinned; and you shall have the
      sweetness without the need.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not reply, and they moved away. The church was nearly dark now,
      and melancholy in the extreme. She stood beside him while he locked the
      door, then took the arm he gave her, and wound her way out of the
      churchyard with him. Then they walked to the house together, but the great
      matter having been set at rest, she persisted in talking only on
      indifferent subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Christmas Day, then,' he said, as they were parting at the end of the
      shrubbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I meant Old Christmas Day,' she said evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      'H'm, people do not usually attach that meaning to the words.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No; but I should like it best if it could not be till then?' It seemed to
      be still her instinct to delay the marriage to the utmost.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well, love,' he said gently. ''Tis a fortnight longer still; but
      never mind. Old Christmas Day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      9. THE ELEVENTH OF SEPTEMBER
    </p>
    <p>
      'There. It will be on a Friday!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat upon a little footstool gazing intently into the fire. It was the
      afternoon of the day following that of the steward's successful
      solicitation of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wonder if it would be proper in me to run across the park and tell him
      it is a Friday?' she said to herself, rising to her feet, looking at her
      hat lying near, and then out of the window towards the Old House. Proper
      or not, she felt that she must at all hazards remove the disagreeable,
      though, as she herself owned, unfounded impression the coincidence had
      occasioned. She left the house directly, and went to search for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston was in the timber-yard, looking at the sawyers as they worked.
      Cytherea came up to him hesitatingly. Till within a distance of a few
      yards she had hurried forward with alacrity&mdash;now that the practical
      expression of his face became visible she wished almost she had never
      sought him on such an errand; in his business-mood he was perhaps very
      stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It will be on a Friday,' she said confusedly, and without any preface.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come this way!' said Manston, in the tone he used for workmen, not being
      able to alter at an instant's notice. He gave her his arm and led her back
      into the avenue, by which time he was lover again. 'On a Friday, will it,
      dearest? You do not mind Fridays, surely? That's nonsense.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not seriously mind them, exactly&mdash;but if it could be any other day?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, let us say Old Christmas Eve, then. Shall it be Old Christmas Eve?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, Old Christmas Eve.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your word is solemn, and irrevocable now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly, I have solemnly pledged my word; I should not have promised to
      marry you if I had not meant it. Don't think I should.' She spoke the
      words with a dignified impressiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You must not be vexed at my remark, dearest. Can you think the worse of
      an ardent man, Cytherea, for showing some anxiety in love?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no.' She could not say more. She was always ill at ease when he spoke
      of himself as a piece of human nature in that analytical way, and wanted
      to be out of his presence. The time of day, and the proximity of the
      house, afforded her a means of escape. 'I must be with Miss Aldclyffe now&mdash;will
      you excuse my hasty coming and going?' she said prettily. Before he had
      replied she had parted from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cytherea, was it Mr. Manston I saw you scudding away from in the avenue
      just now?' said Miss Aldclyffe, when Cytherea joined her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Yes." Come, why don't you say more than that? I hate those taciturn
      "Yesses" of yours. I tell you everything, and yet you are as close as wax
      with me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I parted from him because I wanted to come in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a novel and important announcement! Well, is the day fixed?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe's face kindled into intense interest at once. 'Is it
      indeed? When is it to be?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'On Old Christmas Eve.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Old Christmas Eve.' Miss Aldclyffe drew Cytherea round to her front, and
      took a hand in each of her own. 'And then you will be a bride!' she said
      slowly, looking with critical thoughtfulness upon the maiden's delicately
      rounded cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The normal area of the colour upon each of them decreased perceptibly
      after that slow and emphatic utterance by the elder lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe continued impressively, 'You did not say "Old Christmas
      Eve" as a fiancee should have said the words: and you don't receive my
      remark with the warm excitement that foreshadows a bright future.... How
      many weeks are there to the time?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have not reckoned them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not? Fancy a girl not counting the weeks! I find I must take the lead in
      this matter&mdash;you are so childish, or frightened, or stupid, or
      something, about it. Bring me my diary, and we will count them at once.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea silently fetched the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe opened the diary at the page containing the almanac, and
      counted sixteen weeks, which brought her to the thirty-first of December&mdash;a
      Sunday. Cytherea stood by, looking on as if she had no appetite for the
      scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sixteen to the thirty-first. Then let me see, Monday will be the first of
      January, Tuesday the second, Wednesday third, Thursday fourth, Friday
      fifth&mdash;you have chosen a Friday, as I declare!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A Thursday, surely?' said Cytherea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No: Old Christmas Day comes on a Saturday.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The perturbed little brain had reckoned wrong. 'Well, it must be a
      Friday,' she murmured in a reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No: have it altered, of course,' said Miss Aldclyffe cheerfully. 'There's
      nothing bad in Friday, but such a creature as you will be thinking about
      its being unlucky&mdash;in fact, I wouldn't choose a Friday myself to be
      married on, since all the other days are equally available.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall not have it altered,' said Cytherea firmly; 'it has been altered
      once already: I shall let it be.'

    <h2>
      XIII. THE EVENTS OF ONE DAY
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1. THE FIFTH OF JANUARY. BEFORE DAWN
    </h3>
    <p>
      We pass over the intervening weeks. The time of the story is thus advanced
      more than a quarter of a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the midnight preceding the morning which would make her the wife of a
      man whose presence fascinated her into involuntariness of bearing, and
      whom in absence she almost dreaded, Cytherea lay in her little bed, vainly
      endeavouring to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been looking back amid the years of her short though varied past,
      and thinking of the threshold upon which she stood. Days and months had
      dimmed the form of Edward Springrove like the gauzes of a vanishing
      stage-scene, but his dying voice could still be heard faintly behind. That
      a soft small chord in her still vibrated true to his memory, she would not
      admit: that she did not approach Manston with feelings which could by any
      stretch of words be called hymeneal, she calmly owned.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why do I marry him?' she said to herself. 'Because Owen, dear Owen my
      brother, wishes me to marry him. Because Mr. Manston is, and has been,
      uniformly kind to Owen, and to me. "Act in obedience to the dictates of
      common-sense," Owen said, "and dread the sharp sting of poverty. How many
      thousands of women like you marry every year for the same reason, to
      secure a home, and mere ordinary, material comforts, which after all go
      far to make life endurable, even if not supremely happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis right, I suppose, for him to say that. O, if people only knew what a
      timidity and melancholy upon the subject of her future grows up in the
      heart of a friendless woman who is blown about like a reed shaken with the
      wind, as I am, they would not call this resignation of one's self by the
      name of scheming to get a husband. Scheme to marry? I'd rather scheme to
      die! I know I am not pleasing my heart; I know that if I only were
      concerned, I should like risking a single future. But why should I please
      my useless self overmuch, when by doing otherwise I please those who are
      more valuable than I?'
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of desultory reflections like these, which alternated with
      surmises as to the inexplicable connection that appeared to exist between
      her intended husband and Miss Aldclyffe, she heard dull noises outside the
      walls of the house, which she could not quite fancy to be caused by the
      wind. She seemed doomed to such disturbances at critical periods of her
      existence. 'It is strange,' she pondered, 'that this my last night in
      Knapwater House should be disturbed precisely as my first was, no
      occurrence of the kind having intervened.'
    </p>
    <p>
      As the minutes glided by the noise increased, sounding as if some one were
      beating the wall below her window with a bunch of switches. She would
      gladly have left her room and gone to stay with one of the maids, but they
      were without doubt all asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only person in the house likely to be awake, or who would have brains
      enough to comprehend her nervousness, was Miss Aldclyffe, but Cytherea
      never cared to go to Miss Aldclyffe's room, though she was always welcome
      there, and was often almost compelled to go against her will.
    </p>
    <p>
      The oft-repeated noise of switches grew heavier upon the wall, and was now
      intermingled with creaks, and a rattling like the rattling of dice. The
      wind blew stronger; there came first a snapping, then a crash, and some
      portion of the mystery was revealed. It was the breaking off and fall of a
      branch from one of the large trees outside. The smacking against the wall,
      and the intermediate rattling, ceased from that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it was the tree which had caused the noises. The unexplained matter
      was that neither of the trees ever touched the walls of the house during
      the highest wind, and that trees could not rattle like a man playing
      castanets or shaking dice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought, 'Is it the intention of Fate that something connected with
      these noises shall influence my future as in the last case of the kind?'
    </p>
    <p>
      During the dilemma she fell into a troubled sleep, and dreamt that she was
      being whipped with dry bones suspended on strings, which rattled at every
      blow like those of a malefactor on a gibbet; that she shifted and shrank
      and avoided every blow, and they fell then upon the wall to which she was
      tied. She could not see the face of the executioner for his mask, but his
      form was like Manston's.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank Heaven!' she said, when she awoke and saw a faint light struggling
      through her blind. 'Now what were those noises?' To settle that question
      seemed more to her than the event of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pulled the blind aside and looked out. All was plain. The evening
      previous had closed in with a grey drizzle, borne upon a piercing air from
      the north, and now its effects were visible. The hoary drizzle still
      continued; but the trees and shrubs were laden with icicles to an extent
      such as she had never before witnessed. A shoot of the diameter of a pin's
      head was iced as thick as her finger; all the boughs in the park were bent
      almost to the earth with the immense weight of the glistening incumbrance;
      the walks were like a looking-glass. Many boughs had snapped beneath their
      burden, and lay in heaps upon the icy grass. Opposite her eye, on the
      nearest tree, was a fresh yellow scar, showing where the branch that had
      terrified her had been splintered from the trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I never could have believed it possible,' she thought, surveying the
      bowed-down branches, 'that trees would bend so far out of their true
      positions without breaking.' By watching a twig she could see a drop
      collect upon it from the hoary fog, sink to the lowest point, and there
      become coagulated as the others had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Or that I could so exactly have imitated them,' she continued. 'On this
      morning I am to be married&mdash;unless this is a scheme of the great
      Mother to hinder a union of which she does not approve. Is it possible for
      my wedding to take place in the face of such weather as this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      2. MORNING
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brother Owen was staying with Manston at the Old House. Contrary to
      the opinion of the doctors, the wound had healed after the first surgical
      operation, and his leg was gradually acquiring strength, though he could
      only as yet get about on crutches, or ride, or be dragged in a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe had arranged that Cytherea should be married from Knapwater
      House, and not from her brother's lodgings at Budmouth, which was
      Cytherea's first idea. Owen, too, seemed to prefer the plan. The
      capricious old maid had latterly taken to the contemplation of the wedding
      with even greater warmth than had at first inspired her, and appeared
      determined to do everything in her power, consistent with her dignity, to
      render the adjuncts of the ceremony pleasing and complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the weather seemed in flat contradiction of the whole proceeding. At
      eight o'clock the coachman crept up to the House almost upon his hands and
      knees, entered the kitchen, and stood with his back to the fire, panting
      from his exertions in pedestrianism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kitchen was by far the pleasantest apartment in Knapwater House on
      such a morning as this. The vast fire was the centre of the whole system,
      like a sun, and threw its warm rays upon the figures of the domestics,
      wheeling about it in true planetary style. A nervously-feeble imitation of
      its flicker was continually attempted by a family of polished metallic
      utensils standing in rows and groups against the walls opposite, the whole
      collection of shines nearly annihilating the weak daylight from outside. A
      step further in, and the nostrils were greeted by the scent of green herbs
      just gathered, and the eye by the plump form of the cook, wholesome,
      white-aproned, and floury&mdash;looking as edible as the food she
      manipulated&mdash;her movements being supported and assisted by her
      satellites, the kitchen and scullery maids. Minute recurrent sounds
      prevailed&mdash;the click of the smoke-jack, the flap of the flames, and
      the light touches of the women's slippers upon the stone floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coachman hemmed, spread his feet more firmly upon the hearthstone, and
      looked hard at a small plate in the extreme corner of the dresser.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No wedden this mornen&mdash;that's my opinion. In fact, there can't be,'
      he said abruptly, as if the words were the mere torso of a many-membered
      thought that had existed complete in his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kitchen-maid was toasting a slice of bread at the end of a very long
      toasting-fork, which she held at arm's length towards the unapproachable
      fire, travestying the Flanconnade in fencing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bad out of doors, isn't it?' she said, with a look of commiseration for
      things in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bad? Not even a liven soul, gentle or simple, can stand on level ground.
      As to getten up hill to the church, 'tis perfect lunacy. And I speak of
      foot-passengers. As to horses and carriage, 'tis murder to think of 'em. I
      am going to send straight as a line into the breakfast-room, and say 'tis
      a closer.... Hullo&mdash;here's Clerk Crickett and John Day a-comen! Now
      just look at 'em and picture a wedden if you can.'
    </p>
    <p>
      All eyes were turned to the window, from which the clerk and gardener were
      seen crossing the court, bowed and stooping like Bel and Nebo.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'll have to go if it breaks all the horses' legs in the county,' said
      the cook, turning from the spectacle, knocking open the oven-door with the
      tongs, glancing critically in, and slamming it together with a clang.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, O; why shall I?' asked the coachman, including in his auditory by a
      glance the clerk and gardener who had just entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because Mr. Manston is in the business. Did you ever know him to give up
      for weather of any kind, or for any other mortal thing in heaven or
      earth?'
    </p>
    <p>
      '&mdash;&mdash;Mornen so's&mdash;such as it is!' interrupted Mr. Crickett
      cheerily, coming forward to the blaze and warming one hand without looking
      at the fire. 'Mr. Manston gie up for anything in heaven or earth, did you
      say? You might ha' cut it short by sayen "to Miss Aldclyffe," and leaven
      out heaven and earth as trifles. But it might be put off; putten off a
      thing isn't getten rid of a thing, if that thing is a woman. O no, no!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The coachman and gardener now naturally subsided into secondaries. The
      cook went on rather sharply, as she dribbled milk into the exact centre of
      a little crater of flour in a platter&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'It might be in this case; she's so indifferent.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dang my old sides! and so it might be. I have a bit of news&mdash;I
      thought there was something upon my tongue; but 'tis a secret; not a word,
      mind, not a word. Why, Miss Hinton took a holiday yesterday.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes?' inquired the cook, looking up with perplexed curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      'D'ye think that's all?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't be so three-cunning&mdash;if it is all, deliver you from the evil
      of raising a woman's expectations wrongfully; I'll skimmer your pate as
      sure as you cry Amen!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, it isn't all. When I got home last night my wife said, "Miss
      Adelaide took a holiday this mornen," says she (my wife, that is); "walked
      over to Nether Mynton, met the comen man, and got married!" says she.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Got married! what, Lord-a-mercy, did Springrove come?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Springrove, no&mdash;no&mdash;Springrove's nothen to do wi' it&mdash;'twas
      Farmer Bollens. They've been playing bo-peep for these two or three months
      seemingly. Whilst Master Teddy Springrove has been daddlen, and hawken,
      and spetten about having her, she's quietly left him all forsook. Serve
      him right. I don't blame the little woman a bit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Farmer Bollens is old enough to be her father!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, quite; and rich enough to be ten fathers. They say he's so rich that
      he has business in every bank, and measures his money in half-pint cups.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord, I wish it was me, don't I wish 'twas me!' said the scullery-maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, 'twas as neat a bit of stitching as ever I heard of,' continued the
      clerk, with a fixed eye, as if he were watching the process from a
      distance. 'Not a soul knew anything about it, and my wife is the only one
      in our parish who knows it yet. Miss Hinton came back from the wedden,
      went to Mr. Manston, puffed herself out large, and said she was Mrs.
      Bollens, but that if he wished, she had no objection to keep on the house
      till the regular time of giving notice had expired, or till he could get
      another tenant.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just like her independence,' said the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, independent or no, she's Mrs. Bollens now. Ah, I shall never forget
      once when I went by Farmer Bollens's garden&mdash;years ago now&mdash;years,
      when he was taking up ashleaf taties. A merry feller I was at that time, a
      very merry feller&mdash;for 'twas before I took holy orders, and it didn't
      prick my conscience as 'twould now. "Farmer," says I, "little taties seem
      to turn out small this year, don't em?" "O no, Crickett," says he, "some
      be fair-sized." He's a dull man&mdash;Farmer Bollens is&mdash;he always
      was. However, that's neither here nor there; he's a-married to a sharp
      woman, and if I don't make a mistake she'll bring him a pretty good
      family, gie her time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, it don't matter; there's a Providence in it,' said the
      scullery-maid. 'God A'mighty always sends bread as well as children.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But 'tis the bread to one house and the children to another very often.
      However, I think I can see my lady Hinton's reason for chosen yesterday to
      sickness-or-health-it. Your young miss, and that one, had crossed one
      another's path in regard to young Master Springrove; and I expect that
      when Addy Hinton found Miss Graye wasn't caren to have en, she thought
      she'd be beforehand with her old enemy in marrying somebody else too.
      That's maids' logic all over, and maids' malice likewise.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Women who are bad enough to divide against themselves under a man's
      partiality are good enough to instantly unite in a common cause against
      his attack. 'I'll just tell you one thing then,' said the cook, shaking
      out her words to the time of a whisk she was beating eggs with. 'Whatever
      maids' logic is and maids' malice too, if Cytherea Graye even now knows
      that young Springrove is free again, she'll fling over the steward as soon
      as look at him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no: not now,' the coachman broke in like a moderator. 'There's honour
      in that maid, if ever there was in one. No Miss Hinton's tricks in her.
      She'll stick to Manston.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pifh!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't let a word be said till the wedden is over, for Heaven's sake,' the
      clerk continued. 'Miss Aldclyffe would fairly hang and quarter me, if my
      news broke off that there wedden at a last minute like this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then you had better get your wife to bolt you in the closet for an hour
      or two, for you'll chatter it yourself to the whole boiling parish if she
      don't! 'Tis a poor womanly feller!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You shouldn't ha' begun it, clerk. I knew how 'twould be,' said the
      gardener soothingly, in a whisper to the clerk's mangled remains.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk turned and smiled at the fire, and warmed his other hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. NOON
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather gave way. In half-an-hour there began a rapid thaw. By ten
      o'clock the roads, though still dangerous, were practicable to the extent
      of the half-mile required by the people of Knapwater Park. One mass of
      heavy leaden cloud spread over the whole sky; the air began to feel damp
      and mild out of doors, though still cold and frosty within.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached the church and passed up the nave, the deep-coloured glass of
      the narrow windows rendering the gloom of the morning almost night itself
      inside the building. Then the ceremony began. The only warmth or spirit
      imported into it came from the bridegroom, who retained a vigorous&mdash;even
      Spenserian&mdash;bridal-mood throughout the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea was as firm as he at this critical moment, but as cold as the air
      surrounding her. The few persons forming the wedding-party were
      constrained in movement and tone, and from the nave of the church came
      occasional coughs, emitted by those who, in spite of the weather, had
      assembled to see the termination of Cytherea's existence as a single
      woman. Many poor people loved her. They pitied her success, why, they
      could not tell, except that it was because she seemed to stand more like a
      statue than Cytherea Graye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she was prettily and carefully dressed; a strange contradiction in a
      man's idea of things&mdash;a saddening, perplexing contradiction. Are
      there any points in which a difference of sex amounts to a difference of
      nature? Then this is surely one. Not so much, as it is commonly put, in
      regard to the amount of consideration given, but in the conception of the
      thing considered. A man emasculated by coxcombry may spend more time upon
      the arrangement of his clothes than any woman, but even then there is no
      fetichism in his idea of them&mdash;they are still only a covering he uses
      for a time. But here was Cytherea, in the bottom of her heart almost
      indifferent to life, yet possessing an instinct with which her heart had
      nothing to do, the instinct to be particularly regardful of those sorry
      trifles, her robe, her flowers, her veil, and her gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The irrevocable words were soon spoken&mdash;the indelible writing soon
      written&mdash;and they came out of the vestry. Candles had been necessary
      here to enable them to sign their names, and on their return to the church
      the light from the candles streamed from the small open door, and across
      the chancel to a black chestnut screen on the south side, dividing it from
      a small chapel or chantry, erected for the soul's peace of some Aldclyffe
      of the past. Through the open-work of this screen could now be seen
      illuminated, inside the chantry, the reclining figures of cross-legged
      knights, damp and green with age, and above them a huge classic monument,
      also inscribed to the Aldclyffe family, heavily sculptured in cadaverous
      marble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning here&mdash;almost hanging to the monument&mdash;was Edward
      Springrove, or his spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weak daylight would never have revealed him, shaded as he was by the
      screen; but the unexpected rays of candle-light in the front showed him
      forth in startling relief to any and all of those whose eyes wandered in
      that direction. The sight was a sad one&mdash;sad beyond all description.
      His eyes were wild, their orbits leaden. His face was of a sickly
      paleness, his hair dry and disordered, his lips parted as if he could get
      no breath. His figure was spectre-thin. His actions seemed beyond his own
      control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston did not see him; Cytherea did. The healing effect upon her heart
      of a year's silence&mdash;a year and a half's separation&mdash;was undone
      in an instant. One of those strange revivals of passion by mere sight&mdash;commoner
      in women than in men, and in oppressed women commonest of all&mdash;had
      taken place in her&mdash;so transcendently, that even to herself it seemed
      more like a new creation than a revival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marrying for a home&mdash;what a mockery it was!
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be said that the means most potent for rekindling old love in a
      maiden's heart are, to see her lover in laughter and good spirits in her
      despite when the breach has been owing to a slight from herself; when
      owing to a slight from him, to see him suffering for his own fault. If he
      is happy in a clear conscience, she blames him; if he is miserable because
      deeply to blame, she blames herself. The latter was Cytherea's case now.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, an agony of face told of the suppressed misery within her, which
      presently could be suppressed no longer. When they were coming out of the
      porch, there broke from her in a low plaintive scream the words, 'He's
      dying&mdash;dying! O God, save us!' She began to sink down, and would have
      fallen had not Manston caught her. The chief bridesmaid applied her
      vinaigrette.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What did she say?' inquired Manston.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen was the only one to whom the words were intelligible, and he was far
      too deeply impressed, or rather alarmed, to reply. She did not faint, and
      soon began to recover her self-command. Owen took advantage of the
      hindrance to step back to where the apparition had been seen. He was
      enraged with Springrove for what he considered an unwarrantable intrusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Edward was not in the chantry. As he had come, so he had gone, nobody
      could tell how or whither.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. AFTERNOON
    </p>
    <p>
      It might almost have been believed that a transmutation had taken place in
      Cytherea's idiosyncrasy, that her moral nature had fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding-party returned to the house. As soon as he could find an
      opportunity, Owen took his sister aside to speak privately with her on
      what had happened. The expression of her face was hard, wild, and unreal&mdash;an
      expression he had never seen there before, and it disturbed him. He spoke
      to her severely and sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cytherea,' he said, 'I know the cause of this emotion of yours. But
      remember this, there was no excuse for it. You should have been woman
      enough to control yourself. Remember whose wife you are, and don't think
      anything more of a mean-spirited fellow like Springrove; he had no
      business to come there as he did. You are altogether wrong, Cytherea, and
      I am vexed with you more than I can say&mdash;very vexed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Say ashamed of me at once,' she bitterly answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am ashamed of you,' he retorted angrily; 'the mood has not left you
      yet, then?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Owen,' she said, and paused. Her lip trembled; her eye told of sensations
      too deep for tears. 'No, Owen, it has not left me; and I will be honest. I
      own now to you, without any disguise of words, what last night I did not
      own to myself, because I hardly knew of it. I love Edward Springrove with
      all my strength, and heart, and soul. You call me a wanton for it, don't
      you? I don't care; I have gone beyond caring for anything!' She looked
      stonily into his face and made the speech calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, poor Cytherea, don't talk like that!' he said, alarmed at her
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thought that I did not love him at all,' she went on hysterically. 'A
      year and a half had passed since we met. I could go by the gate of his
      garden without thinking of him&mdash;look at his seat in church and not
      care. But I saw him this morning&mdash;dying because he loves me so&mdash;I
      know it is that! Can I help loving him too? No, I cannot, and I will love
      him, and I don't care! We have been separated somehow by some contrivance&mdash;I
      know we have. O, if I could only die!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He held her in his arms. 'Many a woman has gone to ruin herself,' he said,
      'and brought those who love her into disgrace, by acting upon such
      impulses as possess you now. I have a reputation to lose as well as you.
      It seems that do what I will by way of remedying the stains which fell
      upon us, it is all doomed to be undone again.' His voice grew husky as he
      made the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The right and only effective chord had been touched. Since she had seen
      Edward, she had thought only of herself and him. Owen&mdash;her name&mdash;position&mdash;future&mdash;had
      been as if they did not exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I won't give way and become a disgrace to <i>you</i>, at any rate,' she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Besides, your duty to society, and those about you, requires that you
      should live with (at any rate) all the appearance of a good wife, and try
      to love your husband.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes&mdash;my duty to society,' she murmured. 'But ah, Owen, it is
      difficult to adjust our outer and inner life with perfect honesty to all!
      Though it may be right to care more for the benefit of the many than for
      the indulgence of your own single self, when you consider that the many,
      and duty to them, only exist to you through your own existence, what can
      be said? What do our own acquaintances care about us? Not much. I think of
      mine. Mine will now (do they learn all the wicked frailty of my heart in
      this affair) look at me, smile sickly, and condemn me. And perhaps, far in
      time to come, when I am dead and gone, some other's accent, or some
      other's song, or thought, like an old one of mine, will carry them back to
      what I used to say, and hurt their hearts a little that they blamed me so
      soon. And they will pause just for an instant, and give a sigh to me, and
      think, "Poor girl!" believing they do great justice to my memory by this.
      But they will never, never realize that it was my single opportunity of
      existence, as well as of doing my duty, which they are regarding; they
      will not feel that what to them is but a thought, easily held in those two
      words of pity, "Poor girl!" was a whole life to me; as full of hours,
      minutes, and peculiar minutes, of hopes and dreads, smiles, whisperings,
      tears, as theirs: that it was my world, what is to them their world, and
      they in that life of mine, however much I cared for them, only as the
      thought I seem to them to be. Nobody can enter into another's nature
      truly, that's what is so grievous.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, it cannot be helped,' said Owen.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But we must not stay here,' she continued, starting up and going. 'We
      shall be missed. I'll do my best, Owen&mdash;I will, indeed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been decided that on account of the wretched state of the roads,
      the newly-married pair should not drive to the station till the latest
      hour in the afternoon at which they could get a train to take them to
      Southampton (their destination that night) by a reasonable time in the
      evening. They intended the next morning to cross to Havre, and thence to
      Paris&mdash;a place Cytherea had never visited&mdash;for their wedding
      tour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon drew on. The packing was done. Cytherea was so restless that
      she could stay still nowhere. Miss Aldclyffe, who, though she took little
      part in the day's proceedings, was, as it were, instinctively conscious of
      all their movements, put down her charge's agitation for once as the
      natural result of the novel event, and Manston himself was as indulgent as
      could be wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Cytherea wandered alone into the conservatory. When in it, she
      thought she would run across to the hot-house in the outer garden, having
      in her heart a whimsical desire that she should also like to take a last
      look at the familiar flowers and luxuriant leaves collected there. She
      pulled on a pair of overshoes, and thither she went. Not a soul was in or
      around the place. The gardener was making merry on Manston's and her
      account.
    </p>
    <p>
      The happiness that a generous spirit derives from the belief that it
      exists in others is often greater than the primary happiness itself. The
      gardener thought 'How happy they are!' and the thought made him happier
      than they.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming out of the forcing-house again, she was on the point of returning
      indoors, when a feeling that these moments of solitude would be her last
      of freedom induced her to prolong them a little, and she stood still,
      unheeding the wintry aspect of the curly-leaved plants, the straw-covered
      beds, and the bare fruit-trees around her. The garden, no part of which
      was visible from the house, sloped down to a narrow river at the foot,
      dividing it from the meadows without.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man was lingering along the public path on the other side of the river;
      she fancied she knew the form. Her resolutions, taken in the presence of
      Owen, did not fail her now. She hoped and prayed that it might not be one
      who had stolen her heart away, and still kept it. Why should he have
      reappeared at all, when he had declared that he went out of her sight for
      ever?
    </p>
    <p>
      She hastily hid herself, in the lowest corner of the garden close to the
      river. A large dead tree, thickly robed in ivy, had been considerably
      depressed by its icy load of the morning, and hung low over the stream,
      which here ran slow and deep. The tree screened her from the eyes of any
      passer on the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited timidly, and her timidity increased. She would not allow
      herself to see him&mdash;she would hear him pass, and then look to see if
      it had been Edward.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, before she heard anything, she became aware of an object reflected in
      the water from under the tree which hung over the river in such a way
      that, though hiding the actual path, and objects upon it, it permitted
      their reflected images to pass beneath its boughs. The reflected form was
      that of the man she had seen further off, but being inverted, she could
      not definitely characterize him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was looking at the upper windows of the House&mdash;at hers&mdash;was
      it Edward, indeed? If so, he was probably thinking he would like to say
      one parting word. He came closer, gazed into the stream, and walked very
      slowly. She was almost certain that it was Edward. She kept more safely
      hidden. Conscience told her that she ought not to see him. But she
      suddenly asked herself a question: 'Can it be possible that he sees my
      reflected image, as I see his? Of course he does!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was looking at her in the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not help herself now. She stepped forward just as he emerged
      from the other side of the tree and appeared erect before her. It was
      Edward Springrove&mdash;till the inverted vision met his eye, dreaming no
      more of seeing his Cytherea there than of seeing the dead themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cytherea!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Springrove,' she returned, in a low voice, across the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the first to speak again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Since we have met, I want to tell you something, before we become quite
      as strangers to each other.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No&mdash;not now&mdash;I did not mean to speak&mdash;it is not right,
      Edward.' She spoke hurriedly and turned away from him, beating the air
      with her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not one common word of explanation?' he implored. 'Don't think I am bad
      enough to try to lead you astray. Well, go&mdash;it is better.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes met again. She was nearly choked. O, how she longed&mdash;and
      dreaded&mdash;to hear his explanation!
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is it?' she said desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is that I did not come to the church this morning in order to distress
      you: I did not, Cytherea. It was to try to speak to you before you were&mdash;married.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped closer, and went on, 'You know what has taken place? Surely you
      do?&mdash;my cousin is married, and I am free.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Married&mdash;and not to you?' Cytherea faltered, in a weak whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, she was married yesterday! A rich man had appeared, and she jilted
      me. She said she never would have jilted a stranger, but that by jilting
      me, she only exercised the right everybody has of snubbing their own
      relations. But that's nothing now. I came to you to ask once more if....
      But I was too late.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, Edward, what's that, what's that!' she cried, in an agony of
      reproach. 'Why did you leave me to return to her? Why did you write me
      that cruel, cruel letter that nearly killed me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cytherea! Why, you had grown to love&mdash;like&mdash;Mr. Manston, and
      how could you be anything to me&mdash;or care for me? Surely I acted
      naturally?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no&mdash;never! I loved you&mdash;only you&mdash;not him&mdash;always
      you!&mdash;till lately.... I try to love him now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But that can't be correct! Miss Aldclyffe told me that you wanted to hear
      no more of me&mdash;proved it to me!' said Edward.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never! she couldn't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She did, Cytherea. And she sent me a letter&mdash;a love-letter, you
      wrote to Mr. Manston.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A love-letter I wrote?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, a love-letter&mdash;you could not meet him just then, you said you
      were sorry, but the emotion you had felt with him made you forgetful of
      realities.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The strife of thought in the unhappy girl who listened to this distortion
      of her meaning could find no vent in words. And then there followed the
      slow revelation in return, bringing with it all the misery of an
      explanation which comes too late. The question whether Miss Aldclyffe were
      schemer or dupe was almost passed over by Cytherea, under the immediate
      oppressiveness of her despair in the sense that her position was
      irretrievable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so Springrove. He saw through all the cunning half-misrepresentations&mdash;worse
      than downright lies&mdash;which had just been sufficient to turn the scale
      both with him and with her; and from the bottom of his soul he cursed the
      woman and man who had brought all this agony upon him and his Love. But he
      could not add more misery to the future of the poor child by revealing too
      much. The whole scheme she should never know.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was indifferent to my own future,' Edward said, 'and was urged to
      promise adherence to my engagement with my cousin Adelaide by Miss
      Aldclyffe: now you are married I cannot tell you how, but it was on
      account of my father. Being forbidden to think of you, what did I care
      about anything? My new thought that you still loved me was first raised by
      what my father said in the letter announcing my cousin's marriage. He said
      that although you were to be married on Old Christmas Day&mdash;that is
      to-morrow&mdash;he had noticed your appearance with pity: he thought you
      loved me still. It was enough for me&mdash;I came down by the earliest
      morning train, thinking I could see you some time to-day, the day, as I
      thought, before your marriage, hoping, but hardly daring to hope, that you
      might be induced to marry me. I hurried from the station; when I reached
      the village I saw idlers about the church, and the private gate leading to
      the House open. I ran into the church by the small door and saw you come
      out of the vestry; I was too late. I have now told you. I was compelled to
      tell you. O, my lost darling, now I shall live content&mdash;or die
      content!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am to blame, Edward, I am,' she said mournfully; 'I was taught to dread
      pauperism; my nights were made sleepless; there was continually reiterated
      in my ears till I believed it&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     '"The world and its ways have a certain worth,
       And to press a point where these oppose
       Were a simple policy."
</pre>
    <p>
      'But I will say nothing about who influenced&mdash;who persuaded. The act
      is mine, after all. Edward, I married to escape dependence for my bread
      upon the whim of Miss Aldclyffe, or others like her. It was clearly
      represented to me that dependence is bearable if we have another place
      which we can call home; but to be a dependent and to have no other spot
      for the heart to anchor upon&mdash;O, it is mournful and harassing!... But
      that without which all persuasion would have been as air, was added by my
      miserable conviction that you were false; that did it, that turned me! You
      were to be considered as nobody to me, and Mr. Manston was invariably
      kind. Well, the deed is done&mdash;I must abide by it. I shall never let
      him know that I do not love him&mdash;never. If things had only remained
      as they seemed to be, if you had really forgotten me and married another
      woman, I could have borne it better. I wish I did not know the truth as I
      know it now! But our life, what is it? Let us be brave, Edward, and live
      out our few remaining years with dignity. They will not be long. O, I hope
      they will not be long!... Now, good-bye, good-bye!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wish I could be near and touch you once, just once,' said Springrove,
      in a voice which he vainly endeavoured to keep firm and clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at the river, then into it; a shoal of minnows was floating
      over the sandy bottom, like the black dashes on miniver; though narrow,
      the stream was deep, and there was no bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cytherea, reach out your hand that I may just touch it with mine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She stepped to the brink and stretched out her hand and fingers towards
      his, but not into them. The river was too wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind,' said Cytherea, her voice broken by agitation, 'I must be
      going. God bless and keep you, my Edward! God bless you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I must touch you, I must press your hand,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came near&mdash;nearer&mdash;nearer still&mdash;their fingers met.
      There was a long firm clasp, so close and still that each hand could feel
      the other's pulse throbbing beside its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My Cytherea! my stolen pet lamb!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced a mute farewell from her large perturbed eyes, turned, and ran
      up the garden without looking back. All was over between them. The river
      flowed on as quietly and obtusely as ever, and the minnows gathered again
      in their favourite spot as if they had never been disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody indoors guessed from her countenance and bearing that her heart was
      near to breaking with the intensity of the misery which gnawed there. At
      these times a woman does not faint, or weep, or scream, as she will in the
      moment of sudden shocks. When lanced by a mental agony of such refined and
      special torture that it is indescribable by men's words, she moves among
      her acquaintances much as before, and contrives so to cast her actions in
      the old moulds that she is only considered to be rather duller than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. HALF-PAST TWO TO FIVE O'CLOCK P.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen accompanied the newly-married couple to the railway-station, and in
      his anxiety to see the last of his sister, left the brougham and stood
      upon his crutches whilst the train was starting.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the husband and wife were about to enter the railway-carriage they
      saw one of the porters looking frequently and furtively at them. He was
      pale, and apparently very ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look at that poor sick man,' said Cytherea compassionately, 'surely he
      ought not to be here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's been very queer to-day, madam, very queer,' another porter answered.
      'He do hardly hear when he's spoken to, and d' seem giddy, or as if
      something was on his mind. He's been like it for this month past, but
      nothing so bad as he is to-day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Poor thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not resist an innate desire to do some just thing on this most
      deceitful and wretched day of her life. Going up to him she gave him
      money, and told him to send to the old manor-house for wine or whatever he
      wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train moved off as the trembling man was murmuring his incoherent
      thanks. Owen waved his hand; Cytherea smiled back to him as if it were
      unknown to her that she wept all the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen was driven back to the Old House. But he could not rest in the lonely
      place. His conscience began to reproach him for having forced on the
      marriage of his sister with a little too much peremptoriness. Taking up
      his crutches he went out of doors and wandered about the muddy roads with
      no object in view save that of getting rid of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clouds which had hung so low and densely during the day cleared from
      the west just now as the sun was setting, calling forth a weakly twitter
      from a few small birds. Owen crawled down the path to the waterfall, and
      lingered thereabout till the solitude of the place oppressed him, when he
      turned back and into the road to the village. He was sad; he said to
      himself&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'If there is ever any meaning in those heavy feelings which are called
      presentiments&mdash;and I don't believe there is&mdash;there will be in
      mine to-day.... Poor little Cytherea!'
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the last low rays of the sun touched the head and shoulders
      of a man who was approaching, and showed him up to Owen's view. It was old
      Mr. Springrove. They had grown familiar with each other by reason of
      Owen's visits to Knapwater during the past year. The farmer inquired how
      Owen's foot was progressing, and was glad to see him so nimble again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How is your son?' said Owen mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is at home, sitting by the fire,' said the farmer, in a sad voice.
      'This morning he slipped indoors from God knows where, and there he sits
      and mopes, and thinks, and thinks, and presses his head so hard, that I
      can't help feeling for him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is he married?' said Owen. Cytherea had feared to tell him of the
      interview in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. I can't quite understand how the matter rests.... Ah! Edward, too,
      who started with such promise; that he should now have become such a
      careless fellow&mdash;not a month in one place. There, Mr. Graye, I know
      what it is mainly owing to. If it hadn't been for that heart affair, he
      might have done&mdash;but the less said about him the better. I don't know
      what we should have done if Miss Aldclyffe had insisted upon the
      conditions of the leases. Your brother-in-law, the steward, had a hand in
      making it light for us, I know, and I heartily thank him for it.' He
      ceased speaking, and looked round at the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have you heard o' what's happened?' he said suddenly; 'I was just coming
      out to learn about it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I haven't heard of anything.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is something very serious, though I don't know what. All I know is
      what I heard a man call out bynow&mdash;that it very much concerns
      somebody who lives in the parish.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems singular enough, even to minds who have no dim beliefs in
      adumbration and presentiment, that at that moment not the shadow of a
      thought crossed Owen's mind that the somebody whom the matter concerned
      might be himself, or any belonging to him. The event about to transpire
      was as portentous to the woman whose welfare was more dear to him than his
      own, as any, short of death itself, could possibly be; and ever
      afterwards, when he considered the effect of the knowledge the next
      half-hour conveyed to his brain, even his practical good sense could not
      refrain from wonder that he should have walked toward the village after
      hearing those words of the farmer, in so leisurely and unconcerned a way.
      'How unutterably mean must my intelligence have appeared to the eye of a
      foreseeing God,' he frequently said in after-time. 'Columbus on the eve of
      his discovery of a world was not so contemptibly unaware.'
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few additional words of common-place the farmer left him, and, as
      has been said, Owen proceeded slowly and indifferently towards the
      village.
    </p>
    <p>
      The labouring men had just left work, and passed the park gate, which
      opened into the street as Owen came down towards it. They went along in a
      drift, earnestly talking, and were finally about to turn in at their
      respective doorways. But upon seeing him they looked significantly at one
      another, and paused. He came into the road, on that side of the
      village-green which was opposite the row of cottages, and turned round to
      the right. When Owen turned, all eyes turned; one or two men went
      hurriedly indoors, and afterwards appeared at the doorstep with their
      wives, who also contemplated him, talking as they looked. They seemed
      uncertain how to act in some matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If they want me, surely they will call me,' he thought, wondering more
      and more. He could no longer doubt that he was connected with the subject
      of their discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first who approached him was a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What has occurred?' said Owen.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, a man ha' got crazy-religious, and sent for the pa'son.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is that all?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sir. He wished he was dead, he said, and he's almost out of his mind
      wi' wishen it so much. That was before Mr. Raunham came.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who is he?' said Owen.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Joseph Chinney, one of the railway-porters; he used to be night-porter.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah&mdash;the man who was ill this afternoon; by the way, he was told to
      come to the Old House for something, but he hasn't been. But has anything
      else happened&mdash;anything that concerns the wedding to-day?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Concluding that the connection which had seemed to be traced between
      himself and the event must in some way have arisen from Cytherea's
      friendliness towards the man, Owen turned about and went homewards in a
      much quieter frame of mind&mdash;yet scarcely satisfied with the solution.
      The route he had chosen led through the dairy-yard, and he opened the
      gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes before this point of time, Edward Springrove was looking over
      one of his father's fields at an outlying hamlet of three or four cottages
      some mile and a half distant. A turnpike-gate was close by the gate of the
      field.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carrier to Casterbridge came up as Edward stepped into the road, and
      jumped down from the van to pay toll. He recognized Springrove. 'This is a
      pretty set-to in your place, sir,' he said. 'You don't know about it, I
      suppose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What?' said Springrove.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carrier paid his dues, came up to Edward, and spoke ten words in a
      confidential whisper: then sprang upon the shafts of his vehicle, gave a
      clinching nod of significance to Springrove, and rattled away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward turned pale with the intelligence. His first thought was, 'Bring
      her home!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The next&mdash;did Owen Graye know what had been discovered? He probably
      did by that time, but no risks of probability must be run by a woman he
      loved dearer than all the world besides. He would at any rate make
      perfectly sure that her brother was in possession of the knowledge, by
      telling it him with his own lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Off he ran in the direction of the old manor-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The path was across arable land, and was ploughed up with the rest of the
      field every autumn, after which it was trodden out afresh. The thaw had so
      loosened the soft earth, that lumps of stiff mud were lifted by his feet
      at every leap he took, and flung against him by his rapid motion, as it
      were doggedly impeding him, and increasing tenfold the customary effort of
      running,
    </p>
    <p>
      But he ran on&mdash;uphill, and downhill, the same pace alike&mdash;like
      the shadow of a cloud. His nearest direction, too, like Owen's, was
      through the dairy-barton, and as Owen entered it he saw the figure of
      Edward rapidly descending the opposite hill, at a distance of two or three
      hundred yards. Owen advanced amid the cows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dairyman, who had hitherto been talking loudly on some absorbing
      subject to the maids and men milking around him, turned his face towards
      the head of the cow when Owen passed, and ceased speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen approached him and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'A singular thing has happened, I hear. The man is not insane, I suppose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not he&mdash;he's sensible enough,' said the dairyman, and paused. He was
      a man noisy with his associates&mdash;stolid and taciturn with strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is it true that he is Chinney, the railway-porter?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's the man, sir.' The maids and men sitting under the cows were all
      attentively listening to this discourse, milking irregularly, and softly
      directing the jets against the sides of the pail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen could contain himself no longer, much as his mind dreaded anything of
      the nature of ridicule. 'The people all seem to look at me, as if
      something seriously concerned me; is it this stupid matter, or what is
      it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Surely, sir, you know better than anybody else if such a strange thing
      concerns you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What strange thing?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't you know! His confessing to Parson Raunham.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What did he confess? Tell me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you really ha'n't heard, 'tis this. He was as usual on duty at the
      station on the night of the fire last year, otherwise he wouldn't ha'
      known it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Known what? For God's sake tell, man!'
    </p>
    <p>
      But at this instant the two opposite gates of the dairy-yard, one on the
      east, the other on the west side, slammed almost simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rector from one, Springrove from the other, came striding across the
      barton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward was nearest, and spoke first. He said in a low voice: 'Your sister
      is not legally married! His first wife is still living! How it comes out I
      don't know!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, here you are at last, Mr. Graye, thank Heaven!' said the rector
      breathlessly. 'I have been to the Old House, and then to Miss Aldclyffe's
      looking for you&mdash;something very extraordinary.' He beckoned to Owen,
      afterwards included Springrove in his glance, and the three stepped aside
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A porter at the station. He was a curious nervous man. He had been in a
      strange state all day, but he wouldn't go home. Your sister was kind to
      him, it seems, this afternoon. When she and her husband had gone, he went
      on with his work, shifting luggage-vans. Well, he got in the way, as if he
      were quite lost to what was going on, and they sent him home at last. Then
      he wished to see me. I went directly. There was something on his mind, he
      said, and told it. About the time when the fire of last November
      twelvemonth was got under, whilst he was by himself in the porter's room,
      almost asleep, somebody came to the station and tried to open the door. He
      went out and found the person to be the lady he had accompanied to
      Carriford earlier in the evening, Mrs. Manston. She asked, when would be
      another train to London? The first the next morning, he told her, was at a
      quarter-past six o'clock from Budmouth, but that it was express, and
      didn't stop at Carriford Road&mdash;it didn't stop till it got to
      Anglebury. "How far is it to Anglebury?" she said. He told her, and she
      thanked him, and went away up the line. In a short time she ran back and
      took out her purse. "Don't on any account say a word in the village or
      anywhere that I have been here, or a single breath about me&mdash;I'm
      ashamed ever to have come." He promised; she took out two sovereigns.
      "Swear it on the Testament in the waiting-room," she said, "and I'll pay
      you these." He got the book, took an oath upon it, received the money, and
      she left him. He was off duty at half-past five. He has kept silence all
      through the intervening time till now, but lately the knowledge he
      possessed weighed heavily upon his conscience and weak mind. Yet the
      nearer came the wedding-day, the more he feared to tell. The actual
      marriage filled him with remorse. He says your sister's kindness
      afterwards was like a knife going through his heart. He thought he had
      ruined her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But whatever can be done? Why didn't he speak sooner?' cried Owen.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He actually called at my house twice yesterday,' the rector continued,
      'resolved, it seems, to unburden his mind. I was out both times&mdash;he
      left no message, and, they say, he looked relieved that his object was
      defeated. Then he says he resolved to come to you at the Old House last
      night&mdash;started, reached the door, and dreaded to knock&mdash;and then
      went home again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here will be a tale for the newsmongers of the county,' said Owen
      bitterly. 'The idea of his not opening his mouth sooner&mdash;the
      criminality of the thing!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, that's the inconsistency of a weak nature. But now that it is put to
      us in this way, how much more probable it seems that she should have
      escaped than have been burnt&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You will, of course, go straight to Mr. Manston, and ask him what it all
      means?' Edward interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course I shall! Manston has no right to carry off my sister unless
      he's her husband,' said Owen. 'I shall go and separate them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly you will,' said the rector.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where's the man?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In his cottage.'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis no use going to him, either. I must go off at once and overtake them&mdash;lay
      the case before Manston, and ask him for additional and certain proofs of
      his first wife's death. An up-train passes soon, I think.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where have they gone?' said Edward.
    </p>
    <p>
      'To Paris&mdash;as far as Southampton this afternoon, to proceed to-morrow
      morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where in Southampton?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I really don't know&mdash;some hotel. I only have their Paris address.
      But I shall find them by making a few inquiries.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The rector had in the meantime been taking out his pocket-book, and now
      opened it at the first page, whereon it was his custom every month to gum
      a small railway time-table&mdash;cut from the local newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The afternoon express is just gone,' he said, holding open the page, 'and
      the next train to Southampton passes at ten minutes to six o'clock. Now it
      wants&mdash;let me see&mdash;five-and-forty minutes to that time. Mr.
      Graye, my advice is that you come with me to the porter's cottage, where I
      will shortly write out the substance of what he has said, and get him to
      sign it. You will then have far better grounds for interfering between Mr.
      and Mrs. Manston than if you went to them with a mere hearsay story.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The suggestion seemed a good one. 'Yes, there will be time before the
      train starts,' said Owen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward had been musing restlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let me go to Southampton in your place, on account of your lameness?' he
      said suddenly to Graye.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am much obliged to you, but I think I can scarcely accept the offer,'
      returned Owen coldly. 'Mr. Manston is an honourable man, and I had much
      better see him myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There is no doubt,' said Mr. Raunham, 'that the death of his wife was
      fully believed in by himself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'None whatever,' said Owen; 'and the news must be broken to him, and the
      question of other proofs asked, in a friendly way. It would not do for Mr.
      Springrove to appear in the case at all.' He still spoke rather coldly;
      the recollection of the attachment between his sister and Edward was not a
      pleasant one to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You will never find them,' said Edward. 'You have never been to
      Southampton, and I know every house there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That makes little difference,' said the rector; 'he will have a cab.
      Certainly Mr. Graye is the proper man to go on the errand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Stay; I'll telegraph to ask them to meet me when I arrive at the
      terminus,' said Owen; 'that is, if their train has not already arrived.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Raunham pulled out his pocket-book again. 'The two-thirty train
      reached Southampton a quarter of an hour ago,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too late to catch them at the station. Nevertheless, the rector
      suggested that it would be worth while to direct a message to 'all the
      respectable hotels in Southampton,' on the chance of its finding them, and
      thus saving a deal of personal labour to Owen in searching about the
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll go and telegraph, whilst you return to the man,' said Edward&mdash;an
      offer which was accepted. Graye and the rector then turned off in the
      direction of the porter's cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward, to despatch the message at once, hurriedly followed the road
      towards the station, still restlessly thinking. All Owen's proceedings
      were based on the assumption, natural under the circumstances, of
      Manston's good faith, and that he would readily acquiesce in any
      arrangement which should clear up the mystery. 'But,' thought Edward,
      'suppose&mdash;and Heaven forgive me, I cannot help supposing it&mdash;that
      Manston is not that honourable man, what will a young and inexperienced
      fellow like Owen do? Will he not be hoodwinked by some specious story or
      another, framed to last till Manston gets tired of poor Cytherea? And then
      the disclosure of the truth will ruin and blacken both their futures
      irremediably.'
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he proceeded to execute his commission. This he put in the form
      of a simple request from Owen to Manston, that Manston would come to the
      Southampton platform, and wait for Owen's arrival, as he valued his
      reputation. The message was directed as the rector had suggested, Edward
      guaranteeing to the clerk who sent it off that every expense connected
      with the search would be paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had the telegram been despatched than his heart sank within him
      at the want of foresight shown in sending it. Had Manston, all the time, a
      knowledge that his first wife lived, the telegram would be a forewarning
      which might enable him to defeat Owen still more signally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst the machine was still giving off its multitudinous series of raps,
      Edward heard a powerful rush under the shed outside, followed by a long
      sonorous creak. It was a train of some sort, stealing softly into the
      station, and it was an up-train. There was the ring of a bell. It was
      certainly a passenger train.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the booking-office window was closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ho, ho, John, seventeen minutes after time and only three stations up the
      line. The incline again?' The voice was the stationmaster's, and the reply
      seemed to come from the guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, the other side of the cutting. The thaw has made it all in a perfect
      cloud of fog, and the rails are as slippery as glass. We had to bring them
      through the cutting at twice.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Anybody else for the four-forty-five express?' the voice continued. The
      few passengers, having crossed over to the other side long before this
      time, had taken their places at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      A conviction suddenly broke in upon Edward's mind; then a wish overwhelmed
      him. The conviction&mdash;as startling as it was sudden&mdash;was that
      Manston was a villain, who at some earlier time had discovered that his
      wife lived, and had bribed her to keep out of sight, that he might possess
      Cytherea. The wish was&mdash;to proceed at once by this very train that
      was starting, find Manston before he would expect from the words of the
      telegram (if he got it) that anybody from Carriford could be with him&mdash;charge
      him boldly with the crime, and trust to his consequent confusion (if he
      were guilty) for a solution of the extraordinary riddle, and the release
      of Cytherea!
    </p>
    <p>
      The ticket-office had been locked up at the expiration of the time at
      which the train was due. Rushing out as the guard blew his whistle, Edward
      opened the door of a carriage and leapt in. The train moved along, and he
      was soon out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Springrove had long since passed that peculiar line which lies across the
      course of falling in love&mdash;if, indeed, it may not be called the
      initial itself of the complete passion&mdash;a longing to cherish; when
      the woman is shifted in a man's mind from the region of mere admiration to
      the region of warm fellowship. At this assumption of her nature, she
      changes to him in tone, hue, and expression. All about the loved one that
      said 'She' before, says 'We' now. Eyes that were to be subdued become eyes
      to be feared for: a brain that was to be probed by cynicism becomes a
      brain that is to be tenderly assisted; feet that were to be tested in the
      dance become feet that are not to be distressed; the once-criticized
      accent, manner, and dress, become the clients of a special pleader.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. FIVE TO EIGHT O'CLOCK P.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that he was fairly on the track, and had begun to cool down, Edward
      remembered that he had nothing to show&mdash;no legal authority whatever
      to question Manston or interfere between him and Cytherea as husband and
      wife. He now saw the wisdom of the rector in obtaining a signed confession
      from the porter. The document would not be a death-bed confession&mdash;perhaps
      not worth anything legally&mdash;but it would be held by Owen; and he
      alone, as Cytherea's natural guardian, could separate them on the mere
      ground of an unproved probability, or what might perhaps be called the
      hallucination of an idiot. Edward himself, however, was as firmly
      convinced as the rector had been of the truth of the man's story, and
      paced backward and forward the solitary compartment as the train wound
      through the dark heathery plains, the mazy woods, and moaning coppices, as
      resolved as ever to pounce on Manston, and charge him with the crime
      during the critical interval between the reception of the telegram and the
      hour at which Owen's train would arrive&mdash;trusting to circumstances
      for what he should say and do afterwards, but making up his mind to be a
      ready second to Owen in any emergency that might arise.
    </p>
    <p>
      At thirty-three minutes past seven he stood on the platform of the station
      at Southampton&mdash;a clear hour before the train containing Owen could
      possibly arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making a few inquiries here, but too impatient to pursue his investigation
      carefully and inductively, he went into the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the expiration of another half-hour he had visited seven hotels and
      inns, large and small, asking the same questions at each, and always
      receiving the same reply&mdash;nobody of that name, or answering to that
      description, had been there. A boy from the telegraph-office had called,
      asking for the same persons, if they recollected rightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reflected awhile, struck again by a painful thought that they might
      possibly have decided to cross the Channel by the night-boat. Then he
      hastened off to another quarter of the town to pursue his inquiries among
      hotels of the more old-fashioned and quiet class. His stained and weary
      appearance obtained for him but a modicum of civility, wherever he went,
      which made his task yet more difficult. He called at three several houses
      in this neighbourhood, with the same result as before. He entered the door
      of the fourth house whilst the clock of the nearest church was striking
      eight.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have a tall gentleman named Manston, and a young wife arrived here this
      evening?' he asked again, in words which had grown odd to his ears from
      very familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A new-married couple, did you say?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'They are, though I didn't say so.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'They have taken a sitting-room and bedroom, number thirteen.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are they indoors?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know. Eliza!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, m'm.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'See if number thirteen is in&mdash;that gentleman and his wife.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, m'm.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Has any telegram come for them?' said Edward, when the maid had gone on
      her errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No&mdash;nothing that I know of.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Somebody did come and ask if a Mr. and Mrs. Masters, or some such name,
      were here this evening,' said another voice from the back of the
      bar-parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And did they get the message?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course they did not&mdash;they were not here&mdash;they didn't come
      till half-an-hour after that. The man who made inquiries left no message.
      I told them when they came that they, or a name something like theirs, had
      been asked for, but they didn't seem to understand why it should be, and
      so the matter dropped.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The chambermaid came back. 'The gentleman is not in, but the lady is. Who
      shall I say?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nobody,' said Edward. For it now became necessary to reflect upon his
      method of proceeding. His object in finding their whereabouts&mdash;apart
      from the wish to assist Owen&mdash;had been to see Manston, ask him flatly
      for an explanation, and confirm the request of the message in the presence
      of Cytherea&mdash;so as to prevent the possibility of the steward's
      palming off a story upon Cytherea, or eluding her brother when he came.
      But here were two important modifications of the expected condition of
      affairs. The telegram had not been received, and Cytherea was in the house
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated as to the propriety of intruding upon her in Manston's
      absence. Besides, the women at the bottom of the stairs would see him&mdash;his
      intrusion would seem odd&mdash;and Manston might return at any moment. He
      certainly might call, and wait for Manston with the accusation upon his
      tongue, as he had intended. But it was a doubtful course. That idea had
      been based upon the assumption that Cytherea was not married. If the first
      wife were really dead after all&mdash;and he felt sick at the thought&mdash;Cytherea
      as the steward's wife might in after-years&mdash;perhaps, at once&mdash;be
      subjected to indignity and cruelty on account of an old lover's
      interference now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, perhaps the announcement would come most properly and safely for her
      from her brother Owen, the time of whose arrival had almost expired.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, on turning round, he saw that the staircase and passage were quite
      deserted. He and his errand had as completely died from the minds of the
      attendants as if they had never been. There was absolutely nothing between
      him and Cytherea's presence. Reason was powerless now; he must see her&mdash;right
      or wrong, fair or unfair to Manston&mdash;offensive to her brother or no.
      His lips must be the first to tell the alarming story to her. Who loved
      her as he! He went back lightly through the hall, up the stairs, two at a
      time, and followed the corridor till he came to the door numbered
      thirteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knocked softly: nobody answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no time to lose if he would speak to Cytherea before Manston
      came. He turned the handle of the door and looked in. The lamp on the
      table burned low, and showed writing materials open beside it; the chief
      light came from the fire, the direct rays of which were obscured by a
      sweet familiar outline of head and shoulders&mdash;still as precious to
      him as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. A QUARTER-PAST EIGHT O'CLOCK P.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is an attitude&mdash;approximatively called pensive&mdash;in which
      the soul of a human being, and especially of a woman, dominates outwardly
      and expresses its presence so strongly, that the intangible essence seems
      more apparent than the body itself. This was Cytherea's expression now.
      What old days and sunny eves at Budmouth Bay was she picturing? Her
      reverie had caused her not to notice his knock.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cytherea!' he said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She let drop her hand, and turned her head, evidently thinking that her
      visitor could be no other than Manston, yet puzzled at the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no preface on Springrove's tongue; he forgot his position&mdash;hers&mdash;that
      he had come to ask quietly if Manston had other proofs of being a widower&mdash;everything&mdash;and
      jumped to a conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are not his wife, Cytherea&mdash;come away, he has a wife living!' he
      cried in an agitated whisper. 'Owen will be here directly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She started up, recognized the tidings first, the bearer of them
      afterwards. 'Not his wife? O, what is it&mdash;what&mdash;who is living?'
      She awoke by degrees. 'What must I do? Edward, it is you! Why did you
      come? Where is Owen?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What has Manston shown you in proof of the death of his other wife? Tell
      me quick.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing&mdash;we have never spoken of the subject. Where is my brother
      Owen? I want him, I want him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is coming by-and-by. Come to the station to meet him&mdash;do,'
      implored Springrove. 'If Mr. Manston comes, he will keep you from me: I am
      nobody,' he added bitterly, feeling the reproach her words had faintly
      shadowed forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Manston is only gone out to post a letter he has just written,' she
      said, and without being distinctly cognizant of the action, she wildly
      looked for her bonnet and cloak, and began putting them on, but in the act
      of fastening them uttered a spasmodic cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I'll not go out with you,' she said, flinging the articles down
      again. Running to the door she flitted along the passage, and downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Give me a private room&mdash;quite private,' she said breathlessly to
      some one below.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Number twelve is a single room, madam, and unoccupied,' said some tongue
      in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without waiting for any person to show her into it, Cytherea hurried
      upstairs again, brushed through the corridor, entered the room specified,
      and closed the door. Edward heard her sob out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nobody but Owen shall speak to me&mdash;nobody!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He will be here directly,' said Springrove, close against the panel, and
      then went towards the stairs. He had seen her; it was enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      He descended, stepped into the street, and hastened to meet Owen at the
      railway-station.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the poor maiden who had received the news, she knew not what to
      think. She listened till the echo of Edward's footsteps had died away,
      then bowed her face upon the bed. Her sudden impulse had been to escape
      from sight. Her weariness after the unwonted strain, mental and bodily,
      which had been put upon her by the scenes she had passed through during
      the long day, rendered her much more timid and shaken by her position than
      she would naturally have been. She thought and thought of that single fact
      which had been told her&mdash;that the first Mrs. Manston was still living&mdash;till
      her brain seemed ready to burst its confinement with excess of throbbing.
      It was only natural that she should, by degrees, be unable to separate the
      discovery, which was matter of fact, from the suspicion of treachery on
      her husband's part, which was only matter of inference. And thus there
      arose in her a personal fear of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Suppose he should come in now and seize me!' This at first mere frenzied
      supposition grew by degrees to a definite horror of his presence, and
      especially of his intense gaze. Thus she raised herself to a heat of
      excitement, which was none the less real for being vented in no cry of any
      kind. No; she could not meet Manston's eye alone, she would only see him
      in her brother's company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost delirious with this idea, she ran and locked the door to prevent
      all possibility of her intentions being nullified, or a look or word being
      flung at her by anybody whilst she knew not what she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. HALF-PAST EIGHT O'CLOCK P.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Cytherea felt her way amid the darkness of the room till she came to
      the head of the bed, where she searched for the bell-rope and gave it a
      pull. Her summons was speedily answered by the landlady herself, whose
      curiosity to know the meaning of these strange proceedings knew no bounds.
      The landlady attempted to turn the handle of the door. Cytherea kept the
      door locked. 'Please tell Mr. Manston when he comes that I am ill,' she
      said from the inside, 'and that I cannot see him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly I will, madam,' said the landlady. 'Won't you have a fire?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, thank you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nor a light?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't want one, thank you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nor anything?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady withdrew, thinking her visitor half insane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston came in about five minutes later, and went at once up to the
      sitting-room, fully expecting to find his wife there. He looked round,
      rang, and was told the words Cytherea had said, that she was too ill to be
      seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is in number twelve room,' added the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston was alarmed, and knocked at the door. 'Cytherea!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am unwell, I cannot see you,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are you seriously ill, dearest? Surely not.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, not seriously.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let me come in; I will get a doctor.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, he can't see me either.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She won't open the door, sir, not to nobody at all!' said the
      chambermaid, with wonder-waiting eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hold your tongue, and be off!' said Manston with a snap.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come, Cytherea, this is foolish&mdash;indeed it is&mdash;not opening the
      door.... I cannot comprehend what can be the matter with you. Nor can a
      doctor either, unless he sees you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice had trembled more and more at each answer she gave, but nothing
      could induce her to come out and confront him. Hating scenes, Manston went
      back to the sitting-room, greatly irritated and perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there Cytherea from the adjoining room could hear him pacing up and
      down. She thought, 'Suppose he insists upon seeing me&mdash;he probably
      may&mdash;and will burst open the door!' This notion increased, and she
      sank into a corner in a half-somnolent state, but with ears alive to the
      slightest sound. Reason could not overthrow the delirious fancy that
      outside her door stood Manston and all the people in the hotel, waiting to
      laugh her to scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. HALF-PAST EIGHT TO ELEVEN P.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Springrove was pacing up and down the arrival platform of
      the railway-station. Half-past eight o'clock&mdash;the time at which
      Owen's train was due&mdash;had come, and passed, but no train appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      'When will the eight-thirty train be in?' he asked of a man who was
      sweeping the mud from the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is not expected yet this hour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How is that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Christmas-time, you see, 'tis always so. People are running about to see
      their friends. The trains have been like it ever since Christmas Eve, and
      will be for another week yet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward again went on walking and waiting under the draughty roof. He found
      it utterly impossible to leave the spot. His mind was so intent upon the
      importance of meeting with Owen, and informing him of Cytherea's
      whereabouts, that he could not but fancy Owen might leave the station
      unobserved if he turned his back, and become lost to him in the streets of
      the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour expired. Ten o'clock struck. 'When will the train be in?' said
      Edward to the telegraph clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      'In five-and-thirty minutes. She's now at L&mdash;&mdash;. They have extra
      passengers, and the rails are bad to-day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, at a quarter to eleven, the train came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first to alight from it was Owen, looking pale and cold. He casually
      glanced round upon the nearly deserted platform, and was hurrying to the
      outlet, when his eyes fell upon Edward. At sight of his friend he was
      quite bewildered, and could not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here I am, Mr. Graye,' said Edward cheerfully. 'I have seen Cytherea, and
      she has been waiting for you these two or three hours.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen took Edward's hand, pressed it, and looked at him in silence. Such
      was the concentration of his mind, that not till many minutes after did he
      think of inquiring how Springrove had contrived to be there before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. ELEVEN O'CLOCK P.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their arrival at the door of the hotel, it was arranged between
      Springrove and Graye that the latter only should enter, Edward waiting
      outside. Owen had remembered continually what his friend had frequently
      overlooked, that there was yet a possibility of his sister being Manston's
      wife, and the recollection taught him to avoid any rashness in his
      proceedings which might lead to bitterness hereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering the room, he found Manston sitting in the chair which had been
      occupied by Cytherea on Edward's visit, three hours earlier. Before Owen
      had spoken, Manston arose, and stepping past him closed the door. His face
      appeared harassed&mdash;much more troubled than the slight circumstance
      which had as yet come to his knowledge seemed to account for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston could form no reason for Owen's presence, but intuitively linked
      it with Cytherea's seclusion. 'Altogether this is most unseemly,' he said,
      'whatever it may mean.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't think there is meant anything unfriendly by my coming here,' said
      Owen earnestly; 'but listen to this, and think if I could do otherwise
      than come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He took from his pocket the confession of Chinney the porter, as hastily
      written out by the vicar, and read it aloud. The aspects of Manston's face
      whilst he listened to the opening words were strange, dark, and mysterious
      enough to have justified suspicions that no deceit could be too
      complicated for the possessor of such impulses, had there not overridden
      them all, as the reading went on, a new and irrepressible expression&mdash;one
      unmistakably honest. It was that of unqualified amazement in the steward's
      mind at the news he heard. Owen looked up and saw it. The sight only
      confirmed him in the belief he had held throughout, in antagonism to
      Edward's suspicions.
    </p>
    <p>
      There could no longer be a shadow of doubt that if the first Mrs. Manston
      lived, her husband was ignorant of the fact. What he could have feared by
      his ghastly look at first, and now have ceased to fear, it was quite
      futile to conjecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now I do not for a moment doubt your complete ignorance of the whole
      matter; you cannot suppose for an instant that I do,' said Owen when he
      had finished reading. 'But is it not best for both that Cytherea should
      come back with me till the matter is cleared up? In fact, under the
      circumstances, no other course is left open to me than to request it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever Manston's original feelings had been, all in him now gave way to
      irritation, and irritation to rage. He paced up and down the room till he
      had mastered it; then said in ordinary tones&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly, I know no more than you and others know&mdash;it was a
      gratuitous unpleasantness in you to say you did not doubt me. Why should
      you, or anybody, have doubted me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, where is my sister?' said Owen.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Locked in the next room.'
    </p>
    <p>
      His own answer reminded Manston that Cytherea must, by some inscrutable
      means, have had an inkling of the event.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen had gone to the door of Cytherea's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cytherea, darling&mdash;'tis Owen,' he said, outside the door. A rustling
      of clothes, soft footsteps, and a voice saying from the inside, 'Is it
      really you, Owen,&mdash;is it really?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, will you take care of me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Always.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She unlocked the door, and retreated again. Manston came forward from the
      other room with a candle in his hand, as Owen pushed open the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her frightened eyes were unnaturally large, and shone like stars in the
      darkness of the background, as the light fell upon them. She leapt up to
      Owen in one bound, her small taper fingers extended like the leaves of a
      lupine. Then she clasped her cold and trembling hands round his neck and
      shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of her again kindled all Manston's passions into activity. 'She
      shall not go with you,' he said firmly, and stepping a pace or two closer,
      'unless you prove that she is not my wife; and you can't do it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'This is proof,' said Owen, holding up the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No proof at all,' said Manston hotly. ''Tis not a death-bed confession,
      and those are the only things of the kind held as good evidence.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Send for a lawyer,' Owen returned, 'and let him tell us the proper course
      to adopt.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind the law&mdash;let me go with Owen!' cried Cytherea, still
      holding on to him. 'You will let me go with him, won't you, sir?' she
      said, turning appealingly to Manston.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We'll have it all right and square,' said Manston, with more quietness.
      'I have no objection to your brother sending for a lawyer, if he wants
      to.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was getting on for twelve o'clock, but the proprietor of the hotel had
      not yet gone to bed on account of the mystery on the first floor, which
      was an occurrence unusual in the quiet family lodging. Owen looked over
      the banisters, and saw him standing in the hall. It struck Graye that the
      wisest course would be to take the landlord to a certain extent into their
      confidence, appeal to his honour as a gentleman, and so on, in order to
      acquire the information he wanted, and also to prevent the episode of the
      evening from becoming a public piece of news. He called the landlord up to
      where they stood, and told him the main facts of the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord was fortunately a quiet, prejudiced man, and a meditative
      smoker.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know the very man you want to see&mdash;the very man,' he said, looking
      at the general features of the candle-flame. 'Sharp as a needle, and not
      over-rich. Timms will put you all straight in no time&mdash;trust Timms
      for that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's in bed by this time for certain,' said Owen.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind that&mdash;Timms knows me, I know him. He'll oblige me as a
      personal favour. Wait here a bit. Perhaps, too, he's up at some party or
      another&mdash;he's a nice, jovial fellow, sharp as a needle, too; mind
      you, sharp as a needle, too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He went downstairs, put on his overcoat, and left the house, the three
      persons most concerned entering the room, and standing motionless,
      awkward, and silent in the midst of it. Cytherea pictured to herself the
      long weary minutes she would have to stand there, whilst a sleepy man
      could be prepared for consultation, till the constraint between them
      seemed unendurable to her&mdash;she could never last out the time. Owen
      was annoyed that Manston had not quietly arranged with him at once;
      Manston at Owen's homeliness of idea in proposing to send for an attorney,
      as if he would be a touchstone of infallible proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reflection was cut short by the approach of footsteps, and in a few
      moments the proprietor of the hotel entered, introducing his friend. 'Mr.
      Timms has not been in bed,' he said; 'he had just returned from dining
      with a few friends, so there's no trouble given. To save time I explained
      the matter as we came along.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to Owen and Manston both that they might get a misty
      exposition of the law from Mr. Timms at that moment of concluding dinner
      with a few friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      'As far as I can see,' said the lawyer, yawning, and turning his vision
      inward by main force, 'it is quite a matter for private arrangement
      between the parties, whoever the parties are&mdash;at least at present. I
      speak more as a father than as a lawyer, it is true, but, let the young
      lady stay with her father, or guardian, safe out of shame's way, until the
      mystery is sifted, whatever the mystery is. Should the evidence prove to
      be false, or trumped up by anybody to get her away from you, her husband,
      you may sue them for the damages accruing from the delay.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes,' said Manston, who had completely recovered his self-possession
      and common-sense; 'let it all be settled by herself.' Turning to Cytherea
      he whispered so softly that Owen did not hear the words&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you wish to go back with your brother, dearest, and leave me here
      miserable, and lonely, or will you stay with me, your own husband.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll go back with Owen.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well.' He relinquished his coaxing tone, and went on sternly: 'And
      remember this, Cytherea, I am as innocent of deception in this thing as
      you are yourself. Do you believe me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I had no shadow of suspicion that my first wife lived. I don't think she
      does even now. Do you believe me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I believe you,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And now, good-evening,' he continued, opening the door and politely
      intimating to the three men standing by that there was no further
      necessity for their remaining in his room. 'In three days I shall claim
      her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer and the hotel-keeper retired first. Owen, gathering up as much
      of his sister's clothing as lay about the room, took her upon his arm, and
      followed them. Edward, to whom she owed everything, who had been left
      standing in the street like a dog without a home, was utterly forgotten.
      Owen paid the landlord and the lawyer for the trouble he had occasioned
      them, looked to the packing, and went to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fly, which somewhat unaccountably was seen lingering in front of the
      house, was called up, and Cytherea's luggage put upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you know of any hotel near the station that is open for night
      arrivals?' Owen inquired of the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A place has been bespoke for you, sir, at the White Unicorn&mdash;and the
      gentleman wished me to give you this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bespoken by Springrove, who ordered the fly, of course,' said Owen to
      himself. By the light of the street-lamp he read these lines, hurriedly
      traced in pencil:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have gone home by the mail-train. It is better for all parties that I
      should be out of the way. Tell Cytherea that I apologize for having caused
      her such unnecessary pain, as it seems I did&mdash;but it cannot be helped
      now. E.S.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen handed his sister into the vehicle, and told the flyman to drive on.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Poor Springrove&mdash;I think we have served him rather badly,' he said
      to Cytherea, repeating the words of the note to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thrill of pleasure passed through her bosom as she listened to them.
      They were the genuine reproach of a lover to his mistress; the trifling
      coldness of her answer to him would have been noticed by no man who was
      only a friend. But, in entertaining that sweet thought, she had forgotten
      herself, and her position for the instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was she still Manston's wife&mdash;that was the terrible supposition, and
      her future seemed still a possible misery to her. For, on account of the
      late jarring accident, a life with Manston which would otherwise have been
      only a sadness, must become a burden of unutterable sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she thought of the misrepresentation and scandal that would ensue if
      she were no wife. One cause for thankfulness accompanied the reflection;
      Edward knew the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      They soon reached the quiet old inn, which had been selected for them by
      the forethought of the man who loved her well. Here they installed
      themselves for the night, arranging to go to Budmouth by the first train
      the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this hour Edward Springrove was fast approaching his native county on
      the wheels of the night-mail.

      XIV. THE EVENTS OF FIVE WEEKS
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1. FROM THE SIXTH TO THE THIRTEENTH OF JANUARY
    </h3>
    <p>
      Manston had evidently resolved to do nothing in a hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      This much was plain, that his earnest desire and intention was to raise in
      Cytherea's bosom no feelings of permanent aversion to him. The instant
      after the first burst of disappointment had escaped him in the hotel at
      Southampton, he had seen how far better it would be to lose her presence
      for a week than her respect for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She shall be mine; I will claim the young thing yet,' he insisted. And
      then he seemed to reason over methods for compassing that object, which,
      to all those who were in any degree acquainted with the recent event,
      appeared the least likely of possible contingencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned to Knapwater late the next day, and was preparing to call on
      Miss Aldclyffe, when the conclusion forced itself upon him that nothing
      would be gained by such a step. No; every action of his should be done
      openly&mdash;even religiously. At least, he called on the rector, and
      stated this to be his resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly,' said Mr. Raunham, 'it is best to proceed candidly and fairly,
      or undue suspicion may fall on you. You should, in my opinion, take active
      steps at once.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will do the utmost that lies in my power to clear up the mystery, and
      silence the hubbub of gossip that has been set going about me. But what
      can I do? They say that the man who comes first in the chain of inquiry is
      not to be found&mdash;I mean the porter.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am sorry to say that he is not. When I returned from the station last
      night, after seeing Owen Graye off, I went again to the cottage where he
      has been lodging, to get more intelligence, as I thought. He was not
      there. He had gone out at dusk, saying he would be back soon. But he has
      not come back yet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I rather doubt if we shall see him again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Had I known of this, I would have done what in my flurry I did not think
      of doing&mdash;set a watch upon him. But why not advertise for your
      missing wife as a preliminary, consulting your solicitor in the meantime?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Advertise. I'll think about it,' said Manston, lingering on the word as
      he pronounced it. 'Yes, that seems a right thing&mdash;quite a right
      thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He went home and remained moodily indoors all the next day and the next&mdash;for
      nearly a week, in short. Then, one evening at dusk, he went out with an
      uncertain air as to the direction of his walk, which resulted, however, in
      leading him again to the rectory.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw Mr. Raunham. 'Have you done anything yet?' the rector inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No&mdash;I have not,' said Manston absently. 'But I am going to set about
      it.' He hesitated, as if ashamed of some weakness he was about to betray.
      'My object in calling was to ask if you had heard any tidings from
      Budmouth of my&mdash;Cytherea. You used to speak of her as one you were
      interested in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, at any rate, real sadness in Manston's tone now, and the rector
      paused to weigh his words ere he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have not heard directly from her,' he said gently. 'But her brother has
      communicated with some people in the parish&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The Springroves, I suppose,' said Manston gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; and they tell me that she is very ill, and I am sorry to say, likely
      to be for some days.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Surely, surely, I must go and see her!' Manston cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I would advise you not to go,' said Raunham. 'But do this instead&mdash;be
      as quick as you can in making a movement towards ascertaining the truth as
      regards the existence of your wife. You see, Mr. Manston, an out-step
      place like this is not like a city, and there is nobody to busy himself
      for the good of the community; whilst poor Cytherea and her brother are
      socially too dependent to be able to make much stir in the matter, which
      is a greater reason still why you should be disinterestedly prompt.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The steward murmured an assent. Still there was the same indecision!&mdash;not
      the indecision of weakness&mdash;the indecision of conscious perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Manston's return from this interview at the rectory, he passed the door
      of the Rising Sun Inn. Finding he had no light for his cigar, and it being
      three-quarters of a mile to his residence in the park, he entered the
      tavern to get one. Nobody was in the outer portion of the front room where
      Manston stood, but a space round the fire was screened off from the
      remainder, and inside the high oak settle, forming a part of the screen,
      he heard voices conversing. The speakers had not noticed his footsteps,
      and continued their discourse.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the two he recognized as a well-known night-poacher, the man who
      had met him with tidings of his wife's death on the evening of the
      conflagration. The other seemed to be a stranger following the same mode
      of life. The conversation was carried on in the emphatic and confidential
      tone of men who are slightly intoxicated, its subject being an
      unaccountable experience that one of them had had on the night of the
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the steward heard was enough, and more than enough, to lead him to
      forget or to renounce his motive in entering. The effect upon him was
      strange and strong. His first object seemed to be to escape from the house
      again without being seen or heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having accomplished this, he went in at the park gate, and strode off
      under the trees to the Old House. There sitting down by the fire, and
      burying himself in reflection, he allowed the minutes to pass by unheeded.
      First the candle burnt down in its socket and stunk: he did not notice it.
      Then the fire went out: he did not see it. His feet grew cold; still he
      thought on.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be remarked that a lady, a year and a quarter before this time,
      had, under the same conditions&mdash;an unrestricted mental absorption&mdash;shown
      nearly the same peculiarities as this man evinced now. The lady was Miss
      Aldclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was half-past twelve when Manston moved, as if he had come to a
      determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing he did the next morning was to call at Knapwater House;
      where he found that Miss Aldclyffe was not well enough to see him. She had
      been ailing from slight internal haemorrhage ever since the confession of
      the porter Chinney. Apparently not much aggrieved at the denial, he
      shortly afterwards went to the railway-station and took his departure for
      London, leaving a letter for Miss Aldclyffe, stating the reason of his
      journey thither&mdash;to recover traces of his missing wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the remainder of the week paragraphs appeared in the local and
      other newspapers, drawing attention to the facts of this singular case.
      The writers, with scarcely an exception, dwelt forcibly upon a feature
      which had at first escaped the observation of the villagers, including Mr.
      Raunham&mdash;that if the announcement of the man Chinney were true, it
      seemed extremely probable that Mrs. Manston left her watch and keys behind
      on purpose to blind people as to her escape; and that therefore she would
      not now let herself be discovered, unless a strong pressure were put upon
      her. The writers added that the police were on the track of the porter,
      who very possibly had absconded in the fear that his reticence was
      criminal, and that Mr. Manston, the husband, was, with praiseworthy
      energy, making every effort to clear the whole matter up.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. FROM THE EIGHTEENTH TO THE END OF JANUARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Five days from the time of his departure, Manston returned from London and
      Liverpool, looking very fatigued and thoughtful. He explained to the
      rector and other of his acquaintance that all the inquiries he had made at
      his wife's old lodgings and his own had been totally barren of results.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he seemed inclined to push the affair to a clear conclusion now that
      he had commenced. After the lapse of another day or two he proceeded to
      fulfil his promise to the rector, and advertised for the missing woman in
      three of the London papers. The advertisement was a carefully considered
      and even attractive effusion, calculated to win the heart, or at least the
      understanding, of any woman who had a spark of her own nature left in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later he repeated the experiment; with the same result as
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot try any further,' said Manston speciously to the rector, his
      sole auditor throughout the proceedings. 'Mr. Raunham, I'll tell you the
      truth plainly: I don't love her; I do love Cytherea, and the whole of this
      business of searching for the other woman goes altogether against me. I
      hope to God I shall never see her again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you will do your duty at least?' said Mr. Raunham.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have done it,' said Manston. 'If ever a man on the face of this earth
      has done his duty towards an absent wife, I have towards her&mdash;living
      or dead&mdash;at least,' he added, correcting himself, 'since I have lived
      at Knapwater. I neglected her before that time&mdash;I own that, as I have
      owned it before.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should, if I were you, adopt other means to get tidings of her if
      advertising fails, in spite of my feelings,' said the rector emphatically.
      'But at any rate, try advertising once more. There's a satisfaction in
      having made any attempt three several times.'
    </p>
    <p>
      When Manston had left the study, the rector stood looking at the fire for
      a considerable length of time, lost in profound reflection. He went to his
      private diary, and after many pauses, which he varied only by dipping his
      pen, letting it dry, wiping it on his sleeve, and then dipping it again,
      he took the following note of events:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'January 25.&mdash;Mr. Manston has just seen me for the third time on the
      subject of his lost wife. There have been these peculiarities attending
      the three interviews:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'The first. My visitor, whilst expressing by words his great anxiety to do
      everything for her recovery, showed plainly by his bearing that he was
      convinced he should never see her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The second. He had left off feigning anxiety to do rightly by his first
      wife, and honestly asked after Cytherea's welfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The third (and most remarkable). He seemed to have lost all consistency.
      Whilst expressing his love for Cytherea (which certainly is strong) and
      evincing the usual indifference to the first Mrs. Manston's fate, he was
      unable to conceal the intensity of his eagerness for me to advise him to
      <i>advertise again</i> for her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A week after the second, the third advertisement was inserted. A paragraph
      was attached, which stated that this would be the last time the
      announcement would appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. THE FIRST OF FEBRUARY
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, the eleventh hour, the postman brought a letter for Manston,
      directed in a woman's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bachelor friend of the steward's, Mr. Dickson by name, who was somewhat
      of a chatterer&mdash;plenus rimarum&mdash;and who boasted of an endless
      string of acquaintances, had come over from Casterbridge the preceding day
      by invitation&mdash;an invitation which had been a pleasant surprise to
      Dickson himself, insomuch that Manston, as a rule, voted him a bore almost
      to his face. He had stayed over the night, and was sitting at breakfast
      with his host when the important missive arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston did not attempt to conceal the subject of the letter, or the name
      of the writer. First glancing the pages through, he read aloud as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      '"MY HUSBAND,&mdash;I implore your forgiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"During the last thirteen months I have repeated to myself a hundred
      times that you should never discover what I voluntarily tell you now,
      namely, that I am alive and in perfect health.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I have seen all your advertisements. Nothing but your persistence has
      won me round. Surely, I thought, he <i>must</i> love me still. Why else
      should he try to win back a woman who, faithful unto death as she will be,
      can, in a social sense, aid him towards acquiring nothing?&mdash;rather
      the reverse, indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"You yourself state my own mind&mdash;that the only grounds upon which we
      can meet and live together, with a reasonable hope of happiness, must be a
      mutual consent to bury in oblivion all past differences. I heartily and
      willingly forget everything&mdash;and forgive everything. You will do the
      same, as your actions show.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"There will be plenty of opportunity for me to explain the few facts
      relating to my escape on the night of the fire. I will only give the heads
      in this hurried note. I was grieved at your not coming to fetch me, more
      grieved at your absence from the station, most of all by your absence from
      home. On my journey to the inn I writhed under a passionate sense of wrong
      done me. When I had been shown to my room I waited and hoped for you till
      the landlord had gone upstairs to bed. I still found that you did not
      come, and then I finally made up my mind to leave. I had half undressed,
      but I put on my things again, forgetting my watch (and I suppose dropping
      my keys, though I am not sure where) in my hurry, and slipped out of the
      house. The&mdash;"'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, that's a rum story,' said Mr. Dickson, interrupting.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's a rum story?' said Manston hastily, and flushing in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Forgetting her watch and dropping her keys in her hurry.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't see anything particularly wonderful in it. Any woman might do
      such a thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Any woman might if escaping from fire or shipwreck, or any such immediate
      danger. But it seems incomprehensible to me that any woman in her senses,
      who quietly decides to leave a house, should be so forgetful.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'All that is required to reconcile your seeming with her facts is to
      assume that she was not in her senses, for that's what she did plainly, or
      how could the things have been found there? Besides, she's truthful
      enough.' He spoke eagerly and peremptorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, yes, I know that. I merely meant that it seemed rather odd.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes.' Manston read on:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      '"&mdash;and slipped out of the house. The rubbish-heap was burning up
      brightly, but the thought that the house was in danger did not strike me;
      I did not consider that it might be thatched.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"I idled in the lane behind the wood till the last down-train had come
      in, not being in a mood to face strangers. Whilst I was there the fire
      broke out, and this perplexed me still more. However, I was still
      determined not to stay in the place. I went to the railway-station, which
      was now quiet, and inquired of the solitary man on duty there concerning
      the trains. It was not till I had left the man that I saw the effect the
      fire might have on my history. I considered also, though not in any
      detailed manner, that the event, by attracting the attention of the
      village to my former abode, might set people on my track should they doubt
      my death, and a sudden dread of having to go back again to Knapwater&mdash;a
      place which had seemed inimical to me from first to last&mdash;prompted me
      to run back and bribe the porter to secrecy. I then walked on to
      Anglebury, lingering about the outskirts of the town till the morning
      train came in, when I proceeded by it to London, and then took these
      lodgings, where I have been supporting myself ever since by needlework,
      endeavouring to save enough money to pay my passage home to America, but
      making melancholy progress in my attempt. However, all that is changed&mdash;can
      I be otherwise than happy at it? Of course not. I am happy. Tell me what I
      am to do, and believe me still to be your faithful wife, EUNICE.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"My name here is (as before)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     '"MRS. RONDLEY, and my address,
          79 ADDINGTON STREET,
               LAMBETH.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      The name and address were written on a separate slip of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So it's to be all right at last then,' said Manston's friend. 'But after
      all there's another woman in the case. You don't seem very sorry for the
      little thing who is put to such distress by this turn of affairs? I wonder
      you can let her go so coolly.' The speaker was looking out between the
      mullions of the window&mdash;noticing that some of the lights were glazed
      in lozenges, some in squares&mdash;as he said the words, otherwise he
      would have seen the passionate expression of agonized hopelessness that
      flitted across the steward's countenance when the remark was made. He did
      not see it, and Manston answered after a short interval. The way in which
      he spoke of the young girl who had believed herself his wife, whom, a few
      short days ago, he had openly idolized, and whom, in his secret heart, he
      idolized still, as far as such a form of love was compatible with his
      nature, showed that from policy or otherwise, he meant to act up to the
      requirements of the position into which fate appeared determined to drive
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's neither here nor there,' he said; 'it is a point of honour to do
      as I am doing, and there's an end of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. Only I thought you used not to care overmuch about your first
      bargain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I certainly did not at one time. One is apt to feel rather weary of wives
      when they are so devilish civil under all aspects, as she used to be. But
      anything for a change&mdash;Abigail is lost, but Michal is recovered. You
      would hardly believe it, but she seems in fancy to be quite another bride&mdash;in
      fact, almost as if she had really risen from the dead, instead of having
      only done so virtually.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You let the young pink one know that the other has come or is coming?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cui bono?' The steward meditated critically, showing a portion of his
      intensely wide and regular teeth within the ruby lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot say anything to her that will do any good,' he resumed. 'It
      would be awkward&mdash;either seeing or communicating with her again. The
      best plan to adopt will be to let matters take their course&mdash;she'll
      find it all out soon enough.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston found himself alone a few minutes later. He buried his face in his
      hands, and murmured, 'O my lost one! O my Cytherea! That it should come to
      this is hard for me! 'Tis now all darkness&mdash;"a land of darkness as
      darkness itself; and of the shadow of death without any order, and where
      the light is as darkness."'
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, the artificial bearing which this extraordinary man had adopted
      before strangers ever since he had overheard the conversation at the inn,
      left him now, and he mourned for Cytherea aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. THE TWELFTH OF FEBRUARY
    </p>
    <p>
      Knapwater Park is the picture&mdash;at eleven o'clock on a muddy, quiet,
      hazy, but bright morning&mdash;a morning without any blue sky, and without
      any shadows, the earth being enlivened and lit up rather by the spirit of
      an invisible sun than by its bodily presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The local Hunt had met for the day's sport on the open space of ground
      immediately in front of the steward's residence&mdash;called in the list
      of appointments, 'Old House, Knapwater'&mdash;the meet being here once
      every season, for the pleasure of Miss Aldclyffe and her friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning out from one of the first-floor windows, and surveying with the
      keenest interest the lively picture of pink and black coats, rich-coloured
      horses, and sparkling bits and spurs, was the returned and long-lost
      woman, Mrs. Manston.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of those forming the brilliant group were occasionally turned
      towards her, showing plainly that her adventures were the subject of
      conversation equally with or more than the chances of the coming day. She
      did not flush beneath their scrutiny; on the contrary, she seemed rather
      to enjoy it, her eyes being kindled with a light of contented exultation,
      subdued to square with the circumstances of her matronly position.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was, at the distance from which they surveyed her, an attractive woman&mdash;comely
      as the tents of Kedar. But to a close observer it was palpable enough that
      God did not do all the picture. Appearing at least seven years older than
      Cytherea, she was probably her senior by double the number, the artificial
      means employed to heighten the natural good appearance of her face being
      very cleverly applied. Her form was full and round, its voluptuous
      maturity standing out in strong contrast to the memory of Cytherea's
      lissom girlishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems to be an almost universal rule that a woman who once has courted,
      or who eventually will court, the society of men on terms dangerous to her
      honour cannot refrain from flinging the meaning glance whenever the moment
      arrives in which the glance is strongly asked for, even if her life and
      whole future depended upon that moment's abstinence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had a cautious, uxorious husband seen in his wife's countenance what might
      now have been seen in this dark-eyed woman's as she caught a stray glance
      of flirtation from one or other of the red-coated gallants outside, he
      would have passed many days in an agony of restless jealousy and doubt.
      But Manston was not such a husband, and he was, moreover, calmly attending
      to his business at the other end of the manor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steward had fetched home his wife in the most matter-of-fact way a few
      days earlier, walking round the village with her the very next morning&mdash;at
      once putting an end, by this simple solution, to all the riddling
      inquiries and surmises that were rank in the village and its
      neighbourhood. Some men said that this woman was as far inferior to
      Cytherea as earth to heaven; others, older and sager, thought Manston
      better off with such a wife than he would have been with one of Cytherea's
      youthful impulses, and inexperience in household management. All felt
      their curiosity dying out of them. It was the same in Carriford as in
      other parts of the world&mdash;immediately circumstantial evidence became
      exchanged for direct, the loungers in court yawned, gave a final survey,
      and turned away to a subject which would afford more scope for
      speculation.

    <h2>
      XV. THE EVENTS OF THREE WEEKS
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1. FROM THE TWELFTH OF FEBRUARY TO THE SECOND OF MARCH
    </h3>
    <p>
      Owen Graye's recovery from the illness that had incapacitated him for so
      long a time was, professionally, the dawn of a brighter prospect for him
      in every direction, though the change was at first very gradual, and his
      movements and efforts were little more than mechanical. With the
      lengthening of the days, and the revival of building operations for the
      forthcoming season, he saw himself, for the first time, on a road which,
      pursued with care, would probably lead to a comfortable income at some
      future day. But he was still very low down the hill as yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first undertaking entrusted to him in the new year began about a month
      after his return from Southampton. Mr. Gradfield had come back to him in
      the wake of his restored health, and offered him the superintendence, as
      clerk of works, of a church which was to be nearly rebuilt at the village
      of Tolchurch, fifteen or sixteen miles from Budmouth, and about half that
      distance from Carriford.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am now being paid at the rate of a hundred and fifty pounds a year,' he
      said to his sister in a burst of thankfulness, 'and you shall never,
      Cytherea, be at any tyrannous lady's beck and call again as long as I
      live. Never pine or think about what has happened, dear; it's no disgrace
      to you. Cheer up; you'll be somebody's happy wife yet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not say Edward Springrove's, for, greatly to his disappointment, a
      report had reached his ears that the friend to whom Cytherea owed so much
      had been about to pack up his things and sail for Australia. However, this
      was before the uncertainty concerning Mrs. Manston's existence had been
      dispersed by her return, a phenomenon that altered the cloudy relationship
      in which Cytherea had lately been standing towards her old lover, to one
      of distinctness; which result would have been delightful but for
      circumstances about to be mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea was still pale from her recent illness, and still greatly
      dejected. Until the news of Mrs. Manston's return had reached them, she
      had kept herself closely shut up during the day-time, never venturing
      forth except at night. Sleeping and waking she had been in perpetual dread
      lest she should still be claimed by a man whom, only a few weeks earlier,
      she had regarded in the light of a future husband with quiet assent, not
      unmixed with cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the removal of the uneasiness in this direction&mdash;by Mrs.
      Manston's arrival, and her own consequent freedom&mdash;had been the
      imposition of pain in another. Utterly fictitious details of the finding
      of Cytherea and Manston had been invented and circulated, unavoidably
      reaching her ears in the course of time. Thus the freedom brought no
      happiness, and it seemed well-nigh impossible that she could ever again
      show herself the sparkling creature she once had been&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'Apt to entice a deity.'
</pre>
    <p>
      On this account, and for the first time in his life, Owen made a point of
      concealing from her the real state of his feelings with regard to the
      unhappy transaction. He writhed in secret under the humiliation to which
      they had been subjected, till the resentment it gave rise to, and for
      which there was no vent, was sometimes beyond endurance; it induced a mood
      that did serious damage to the material and plodding perseverance
      necessary if he would secure permanently the comforts of a home for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They gave up their lodgings at Budmouth, and went to Tolchurch as soon as
      the work commenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here they were domiciled in one half of an old farmhouse, standing not far
      from the ivy-covered church tower (which was all that was to remain of the
      original structure). The long steep roof of this picturesque dwelling
      sloped nearly down to the ground, the old tiles that covered it being
      overgrown with rich olive-hued moss. New red tiles in twos and threes had
      been used for patching the holes wrought by decay, lighting up the whole
      harmonious surface with dots of brilliant scarlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief internal features of this snug abode were a wide fireplace,
      enormous cupboards, a brown settle, and several sketches on the wood
      mantel, done in outline with the point of a hot poker&mdash;the subjects
      mainly consisting of old men walking painfully erect, with a curly-tailed
      dog behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a week or two of residence in Tolchurch, and rambles amid the quaint
      scenery circumscribing it, a tranquillity began to spread itself through
      the mind of the maiden, which Graye hoped would be a preface to her
      complete restoration. She felt ready and willing to live the whole
      remainder of her days in the retirement of their present quarters: she
      began to sing about the house in low tremulous snatches&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     '"&mdash;I said, if there's peace to be found in the world,
       A heart that is humble may hope for it here."'
</pre>
    <p>
      2. THE THIRD OF MARCH
    </p>
    <p>
      Her convalescence had arrived at this point on a certain evening towards
      the end of the winter, when Owen had come in from the building hard by,
      and was changing his muddy boots for slippers, previously to sitting down
      to toast and tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      A prolonged though quiet knocking came to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only person who ever knocked at their door in that way was the new
      vicar, the prime mover in the church-building. But he was that evening
      dining with the Squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea was uneasy at the sound&mdash;she did not know why, unless it was
      because her nerves were weakened by the sickness she had undergone.
      Instead of opening the door she ran out of the room, and upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What nonsense, Cytherea!' said her brother, going to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Springrove stood in the grey light outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Capital&mdash;not gone to Australia, and not going, of course!' cried
      Owen. 'What's the use of going to such a place as that?&mdash;I never
      believed that you would.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am going back to London again to-morrow,' said Springrove, 'and I
      called to say a word before going. Where is... ?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She has just run upstairs. Come in&mdash;never mind scraping your shoes&mdash;we
      are regular cottagers now; stone floor, yawning chimney-corner, and all,
      you see.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. Manston came,' said Edward awkwardly, when he had sat down in the
      chimney-corner by preference.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.' At mention of one of his skeletons Owen lost his blitheness at
      once, and fell into a reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The history of her escape is very simple.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You know I always had wondered, when my father was telling any of the
      circumstances of the fire to me, how it could be that a woman could sleep
      so soundly as to be unaware of her horrid position till it was too late
      even to give shout or sound of any kind.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I think that would have been possible, considering her long
      wearisome journey. People have often been suffocated in their beds before
      they awoke. But it was hardly likely a body would be completely burnt to
      ashes as this was assumed to be, though nobody seemed to see it at the
      time. And how positive the surgeon was too, about those bits of bone! Why
      he should have been so, nobody can tell. I cannot help saying that if it
      has ever been possible to find pure stupidity incarnate, it was in that
      jury of Carriford. There existed in the mass the stupidity of twelve and
      not the penetration of one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is she quite well?' said Springrove.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who?&mdash;O, my sister, Cytherea. Thank you, nearly well, now. I'll call
      her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wait one minute. I have a word to say to you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You know, without my saying it, that I love Cytherea as dearly as
      ever.... I think she loves me too,&mdash;does she really?'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was in Owen enough of that worldly policy on the subject of
      matchmaking which naturally resides in the breasts of parents and
      guardians, to give him a certain caution in replying, and, younger as he
      was by five years than Edward, it had an odd effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, she may possibly love you still,' he said, as if rather in doubt as
      to the truth of his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Springrove's countenance instantly saddened; he had expected a simple
      'Yes,' at the very least. He continued in a tone of greater depression&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Supposing she does love me, would it be fair to you and to her if I made
      her an offer of marriage, with these dreary conditions attached&mdash;that
      we lived for a few years on the narrowest system, till a great debt, which
      all honour and duty require me to pay off, shall be paid? My father, by
      reason of the misfortune that befell him, is under a great obligation to
      Miss Aldclyffe. He is getting old, and losing his energies. I am
      attempting to work free of the burden. This makes my prospects gloomy
      enough at present.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But consider again,' he went on. 'Cytherea has been left in a nameless
      and unsatisfactory, though innocent state, by this unfortunate, and now
      void, marriage with Manston. A marriage with me, though under the&mdash;materially&mdash;untoward
      conditions I have mentioned, would make us happy; it would give her a
      locus standi. If she wished to be out of the sound of her misfortunes we
      would go to another part of England&mdash;emigrate&mdash;do anything.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll call Cytherea,' said Owen. 'It is a matter which she alone can
      settle.' He did not speak warmly. His pride could not endure the pity
      which Edward's visit and errand tacitly implied. Yet, in the other affair,
      his heart went with Edward; he was on the same beat for paying off old
      debts himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cythie, Mr. Springrove is here,' he said, at the foot of the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sister descended the creaking old steps with a faltering tread, and
      stood in the firelight from the hearth. She extended her hand to
      Springrove, welcoming him by a mere motion of the lip, her eyes averted&mdash;a
      habit which had engendered itself in her since the beginning of her
      illness and defamation. Owen opened the door and went out&mdash;leaving
      the lovers alone. It was the first time they had met since the memorable
      night at Southampton.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will get a light,' she said, with a little embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No&mdash;don't, please, Cytherea,' said Edward softly, 'Come and sit down
      with me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes. I ought to have asked <i>you</i> to,' she returned timidly.
      'Everybody sits in the chimney-corner in this parish. You sit on that
      side. I'll sit here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Two recesses&mdash;one on the right, one on the left hand&mdash;were cut
      in the inside of the fireplace, and here they sat down facing each other,
      on benches fitted to the recesses, the fire glowing on the hearth between
      their feet. Its ruddy light shone on the underslopes of their faces, and
      spread out over the floor of the room with the low horizontality of the
      setting sun, giving to every grain of sand and tumour in the paving a long
      shadow towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward looked at his pale love through the thin azure twines of smoke that
      went up like ringlets between them, and invested her, as seen through its
      medium, with the shadowy appearance of a phantom. Nothing is so potent for
      coaxing back the lost eyes of a woman as a discreet silence in the man who
      has so lost them&mdash;and thus the patient Edward coaxed hers. After
      lingering on the hearth for half a minute, waiting in vain for another
      word from him, they were lifted into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was ready primed to receive them. 'Cytherea, will you marry me?' he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not wait in his original position till the answer came. Stepping
      across the front of the fire to her own side of the chimney corner, he
      reclined at her feet, and searched for her hand. She continued in silence
      awhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Edward, I can never be anybody's wife,' she then said sadly, and with
      firmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Think of it in every light,' he pleaded; 'the light of love, first. Then,
      when you have done that, see how wise a step it would be. I can only offer
      you poverty as yet, but I want&mdash;I do so long to secure you from the
      intrusion of that unpleasant past, which will often and always be thrust
      before you as long as you live the shrinking solitary life you do now&mdash;a
      life which purity chooses, it may be; but to the outside world it appears
      like the enforced loneliness of neglect and scorn&mdash;and tongues are
      busy inventing a reason for it which does not exist.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know all about it,' she said hastily; 'and those are the grounds of my
      refusal. You and Owen know the whole truth&mdash;the two I love best on
      earth&mdash;and I am content. But the scandal will be continually
      repeated, and I can never give any one the opportunity of saying to you&mdash;that&mdash;your
      wife....' She utterly broke down and wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't, my own darling!' he entreated. 'Don't, Cytherea!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Please to leave me&mdash;we will be friends, Edward&mdash;but don't press
      me&mdash;my mind is made up&mdash;I cannot&mdash;I will not marry you or
      any man under the present ambiguous circumstances&mdash;never will I&mdash;I
      have said it: never!'
    </p>
    <p>
      They were both silent. He listlessly regarded the illuminated blackness
      overhead, where long flakes of soot floated from the sides and bars of the
      chimney-throat like tattered banners in ancient aisles; whilst through the
      square opening in the midst one or two bright stars looked down upon them
      from the grey March sky. The sight seemed to cheer him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'At any rate you will love me?' he murmured to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes&mdash;always&mdash;for ever and for ever!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her once, twice, three times, and arose to his feet, slowly
      withdrawing himself from her side towards the door. Cytherea remained with
      her gaze fixed on the fire. Edward went out grieving, but hope was not
      extinguished even now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smelt the fragrance of a cigar, and immediately afterwards saw a small
      red star of fire against the darkness of the hedge. Graye was pacing up
      and down the lane, smoking as he walked. Springrove told him the result of
      the interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are a good fellow, Edward,' he said; 'but I think my sister is
      right.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wish you would believe Manston a villain, as I do,' said Springrove.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It would be absurd of me to say that I like him now&mdash;family feeling
      prevents it, but I cannot in honesty say deliberately that he is a bad
      man.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward could keep the secret of Manston's coercion of Miss Aldclyffe in
      the matter of the houses a secret no longer. He told Owen the whole story.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's one thing,' he continued, 'but not all. What do you think of this&mdash;I
      have discovered that he went to Budmouth post-office for a letter the day
      before the first advertisement for his wife appeared in the papers. One
      was there for him, and it was directed in his wife's handwriting, as I can
      prove. This was not till after the marriage with Cytherea, it is true, but
      if (as it seems to show) the advertising was a farce, there is a strong
      presumption that the rest of the piece was.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen was too astounded to speak. He dropped his cigar, and fixed his eyes
      upon his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Collusion!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'With his first wife?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes&mdash;with his wife. I am firmly persuaded of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What did you discover?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That he fetched from the post-office at Budmouth a letter from her the
      day <i>before</i> the first advertisement appeared.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Graye was lost in a long consideration. 'Ah!' he said, 'it would be
      difficult to prove anything of that sort now. The writing could not be
      sworn to, and if he is guilty the letter is destroyed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have other suspicions&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes&mdash;as you said' interrupted Owen, who had not till now been able
      to form the complicated set of ideas necessary for picturing the position.
      'Yes, there is this to be remembered&mdash;Cytherea had been taken from
      him before that letter came&mdash;and his knowledge of his wife's
      existence could not have originated till after the wedding. I could have
      sworn he believed her dead then. His manner was unmistakable.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I have other suspicions,' repeated Edward; 'and if I only had the
      right&mdash;if I were her husband or brother, he should be convicted of
      bigamy yet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The reproof was not needed,' said Owen, with a little bitterness. 'What
      can I do&mdash;a man with neither money nor friends&mdash;whilst Manston
      has Miss Aldclyffe and all her fortune to back him up? God only knows what
      lies between the mistress and her steward, but since this has transpired&mdash;if
      it is true&mdash;I can believe the connection to be even an unworthy one&mdash;a
      thing I certainly never so much as owned to myself before.'
    </p>
    <p>
      3. THE FIFTH OF MARCH
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward's disclosure had the effect of directing Owen Graye's thoughts into
      an entirely new and uncommon channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Monday after Springrove's visit, Owen had walked to the top of a
      hill in the neighbourhood of Tolchurch&mdash;a wild hill that had no name,
      beside a barren down where it never looked like summer. In the intensity
      of his meditations on the ever-present subject, he sat down on a
      weather-beaten boundary-stone gazing towards the distant valleys&mdash;seeing
      only Manston's imagined form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had his defenceless sister been trifled with? that was the question which
      affected him. Her refusal of Edward as a husband was, he knew, dictated
      solely by a humiliated sense of inadequacy to him in repute, and had not
      been formed till since the slanderous tale accounting for her seclusion
      had been circulated. Was it not true, as Edward had hinted, that he, her
      brother, was neglecting his duty towards her in allowing Manston to thrive
      unquestioned, whilst she was hiding her head for no fault at all?
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it possible that Manston was sensuous villain enough to have
      contemplated, at any moment before the marriage with Cytherea, the return
      of his first wife, when he should have grown weary of his new toy? Had he
      believed that, by a skilful manipulation of such circumstances as chance
      would throw in his way, he could escape all suspicion of having known that
      she lived? Only one fact within his own direct knowledge afforded the
      least ground for such a supposition. It was that, possessed by a woman
      only in the humble and unprotected station of a lady's hired companion,
      his sister's beauty might scarcely have been sufficient to induce a
      selfish man like Manston to make her his wife, unless he had foreseen the
      possibility of getting rid of her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But for that stratagem of Manston's in relation to the Springroves,' Owen
      thought, 'Cythie might now have been the happy wife of Edward. True, that
      he influenced Miss Aldclyffe only rests on Edward's suspicions, but the
      grounds are good&mdash;the probability is strong.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He went indoors and questioned Cytherea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'On the night of the fire, who first said that Mrs. Manston was burnt?' he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know who started the report.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Was it Manston?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was certainly not he. All doubt on the subject was removed before he
      came to the spot&mdash;that I am certain of. Everybody knew that she did
      not escape <i>after</i> the house was on fire, and thus all overlooked the
      fact that she might have left before&mdash;of course that would have
      seemed such an improbable thing for anybody to do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, until the porter's story of her irritation and doubt as to her
      course made it natural.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What settled the matter at the inquest,' said Cytherea, 'was Mr.
      Manston's evidence that the watch was his wife's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He was sure of that, wasn't he?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I believe he said he was certain of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It might have been hers&mdash;left behind in her perturbation, as they
      say it was&mdash;impossible as that seems at first sight. Yes&mdash;on the
      whole, he might have believed in her death.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know by several proofs that then, and at least for some time after, he
      had no other thought than that she was dead. I now think that before the
      porter's confession he knew something about her&mdash;though not that she
      lived.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why do you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'From what he said to me on the evening of the wedding-day, when I had
      fastened myself in the room at the hotel, after Edward's visit. He must
      have suspected that I knew something, for he was irritated, and in a
      passion of uneasy doubt. He said, "You don't suppose my first wife is come
      to light again, madam, surely?" Directly he had let the remark slip out,
      he seemed anxious to withdraw it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's odd,' said Owen.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thought it very odd.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Still we must remember he might only have hit upon the thought by
      accident, in doubt as to your motive. Yes, the great point to discover
      remains the same as ever&mdash;did he doubt his first impression of her
      death <i>before</i> he married you. I can't help thinking he did, although
      he was so astounded at our news that night. Edward swears he did.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was perhaps only a short time before,' said Cytherea; 'when he could
      hardly recede from having me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Seasoning justice with mercy as usual, Cytherea. 'Tis unfair to yourself
      to talk like that. If I could only bring him to ruin as a bigamist&mdash;supposing
      him to be one&mdash;I should die happy. That's what we must find out by
      fair means or foul&mdash;was he a wilful bigamist?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is no use trying, Owen. You would have to employ a solicitor, and how
      can you do that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't at all&mdash;I know that very well. But neither do I altogether
      wish to at present&mdash;a lawyer must have a case&mdash;facts to go upon,
      that means. Now they are scarce at present&mdash;as scarce as money is
      with us, and till we have found more money there is no hurry for a lawyer.
      Perhaps by the time we have the facts we shall have the money. The only
      thing we lose in working alone in this way, is time&mdash;not the issue:
      for the fruit that one mind matures in a twelvemonth forms a more
      perfectly organized whole than that of twelve minds in one month,
      especially if the interests of the single one are vitally concerned, and
      those of the twelve are only hired. But there is not only my mind
      available&mdash;you are a shrewd woman, Cythie, and Edward is an earnest
      ally. Then, if we really get a sure footing for a criminal prosecution,
      the Crown will take up the case.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't much care to press on in the matter,' she murmured. 'What good
      can it do us, Owen, after all?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Selfishly speaking, it will do this good&mdash;that all the facts of your
      journey to Southampton will become known, and the scandal will die.
      Besides, Manston will have to suffer&mdash;it's an act of justice to you
      and to other women, and to Edward Springrove.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He now thought it necessary to tell her of the real nature of the
      Springroves' obligation to Miss Aldclyffe&mdash;and their nearly certain
      knowledge that Manston was the prime mover in effecting their
      embarrassment. Her face flushed as she listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And now,' he said, 'our first undertaking is to find out where Mrs.
      Manston lived during the separation; next, when the first communications
      passed between them after the fire.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If we only had Miss Aldclyffe's countenance and assistance as I used to
      have them,' Cytherea returned, 'how strong we should be! O, what power is
      it that he exercises over her, swaying her just as he wishes! She loves me
      now. Mrs. Morris in her letter said that Miss Aldclyffe prayed for me&mdash;yes,
      she heard her praying for me, and crying. Miss Aldclyffe did not mind an
      old friend like Mrs. Morris knowing it, either. Yet in opposition to this,
      notice her dead silence and inaction throughout this proceeding.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is a mystery; but never mind that now,' said Owen impressively. 'About
      where Mrs. Manston has been living. We must get this part of it first&mdash;learn
      the place of her stay in the early stage of their separation, during the
      period of Manston's arrival here, and so on, for that was where she was
      first communicated with on the subject of coming to Knapwater, before the
      fire; and that address, too, was her point of departure when she came to
      her husband by stealth in the night&mdash;you know&mdash;the time I
      visited you in the evening and went home early in the morning, and it was
      found that he had been visited too. Ah! couldn't we inquire of Mrs. Leat,
      who keeps the post-office at Carriford, if she remembers where the letters
      to Mrs. Manston were directed?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He never posted his letters to her in the parish&mdash;it was remarked at
      the time. I was thinking if something relating to her address might not be
      found in the report of the inquest in the Casterbridge Chronicle of the
      date. Some facts about the inquest were given in the papers to a
      certainty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brother caught eagerly at the suggestion. 'Who has a file of the
      Chronicles?' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Raunham used to file them,' said Cytherea. 'He was rather
      friendly-disposed towards me, too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen could not, on any consideration, escape from his attendance at the
      church-building till Saturday evening; and thus it became necessary,
      unless they actually wasted time, that Cytherea herself should assist. 'I
      act under your orders, Owen,' she said.

    <h2>
      XVI. THE EVENTS OF ONE WEEK
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1. MARCH THE SIXTH
    </h3>
    <p>
      The next morning the opening move of the game was made. Cytherea, under
      cover of a thick veil, hired a conveyance and drove to within a mile or so
      of Carriford. It was with a renewed sense of depression that she saw again
      the objects which had become familiar to her eye during her sojourn under
      Miss Aldclyffe's roof&mdash;the outline of the hills, the meadow streams,
      the old park trees. She hastened by a lonely path to the rectory-house,
      and asked if Mr. Raunham was at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the rector, though a solitary bachelor, was as gallant and courteous
      to womankind as an ancient Iberian; and, moreover, he was Cytherea's
      friend in particular, to an extent far greater than she had ever surmised.
      Rarely visiting his relative, Miss Aldclyffe, except on parish matters,
      more rarely still being called upon by Miss Aldclyffe, Cytherea had learnt
      very little of him whilst she lived at Knapwater. The relationship was on
      the impecunious paternal side, and for this branch of her family the lady
      of the estate had never evinced much sympathy. In looking back upon our
      line of descent it is an instinct with us to feel that all our vitality
      was drawn from the richer party to any unequal marriage in the chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the death of the old captain, the rector's bearing in Knapwater
      House had been almost that of a stranger, a circumstance which he himself
      was the last man in the world to regret. This polite indifference was so
      frigid on both sides that the rector did not concern himself to preach at
      her, which was a great deal in a rector; and she did not take the trouble
      to think his sermons poor stuff, which in a cynical woman was a great deal
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though barely fifty years of age, his hair was as white as snow,
      contrasting strangely with the redness of his skin, which was as fresh and
      healthy as a lad's. Cytherea's bright eyes, mutely and demurely glancing
      up at him Sunday after Sunday, had been the means of driving away many of
      the saturnine humours that creep into an empty heart during the hours of a
      solitary life; in this case, however, to supplant them, when she left his
      parish, by those others of a more aching nature which accompany an
      over-full one. In short, he had been on the verge of feeling towards her
      that passion to which his dignified self-respect would not give its true
      name, even in the privacy of his own thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He received her kindly; but she was not disposed to be frank with him. He
      saw her wish to be reserved, and with genuine good taste and good nature
      made no comment whatever upon her request to be allowed to see the
      Chronicle for the year before the last. He placed the papers before her on
      his study table, with a timidity as great as her own, and then left her
      entirely to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned them over till she came to the first heading connected with the
      subject of her search&mdash;'Disastrous Fire and Loss of Life at
      Carriford.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight, and its calamitous bearing upon her own life, made her so dizzy
      that she could, for a while, hardly decipher the letters. Stifling
      recollection by an effort she nerved herself to her work, and carefully
      read the column. The account reminded her of no other fact than was
      remembered already.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned on to the following week's report of the inquest. After a
      miserable perusal she could find no more pertaining to Mrs. Manston's
      address than this:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'ABRAHAM BROWN, of Hoxton, London, at whose house the deceased woman had
      been living, deposed,' etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody else from London had attended the inquest. She arose to depart,
      first sending a message of thanks to Mr. Raunham, who was out of doors
      gardening.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stuck his spade into the ground, and accompanied her to the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Can I help you in anything, Cytherea?' he said, using her Christian name
      by an intuition that unpleasant memories might be revived if he called her
      Miss Graye after wishing her good-bye as Mrs. Manston at the wedding.
      Cytherea saw the motive and appreciated it, nevertheless replying
      evasively&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I only guess and fear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He earnestly looked at her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Promise me that if you want assistance, and you think I can give it, you
      will come to me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gate closed between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You don't want me to help you in anything now, Cytherea?' he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had spoken what he felt, 'I want very much to help you, Cytherea,
      and have been watching Manston on your account,' she would gladly have
      accepted his offer. As it was, she was perplexed, and raised her eyes to
      his, not so fearlessly as before her trouble, but as modestly, and with
      still enough brightness in them to do fearful execution as she said over
      the gate&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, thank you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned to Tolchurch weary with her day's work. Owen's greeting was
      anxious&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, Cytherea?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him the words from the report of the inquest, pencilled on a slip
      of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now to find out the name of the street and number,' Owen remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Owen,' she said, 'will you forgive me for what I am going to say? I don't
      think I can&mdash;indeed I don't think I can&mdash;take any further steps
      towards disentangling the mystery. I still think it a useless task, and it
      does not seem any duty of mine to be revenged upon Mr. Manston in any
      way.' She added more gravely, 'It is beneath my dignity as a woman to
      labour for this; I have felt it so all day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well,' he said, somewhat shortly; 'I shall work without you then.
      There's dignity in justice.' He caught sight of her pale tired face, and
      the dilated eye which always appeared in her with weariness. 'Darling,' he
      continued warmly, and kissing her, 'you shall not work so hard again&mdash;you
      are worn out quite. But you must let me do as I like.'
    </p>
    <p>
      2. MARCH THE TENTH
    </p>
    <p>
      On Saturday evening Graye hurried off to Casterbridge, and called at the
      house of the reporter to the Chronicle. The reporter was at home, and came
      out to Graye in the passage. Owen explained who and what he was, and asked
      the man if he would oblige him by turning to his notes of the inquest at
      Carriford in the December of the year preceding the last&mdash;just adding
      that a family entanglement, of which the reporter probably knew something,
      made him anxious to ascertain some additional details of the event, if any
      existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly,' said the other, without hesitation; 'though I am afraid I
      haven't much beyond what we printed at the time. Let me see&mdash;my old
      note-books are in my drawer at the office of the paper: if you will come
      with me I can refer to them there.' His wife and family were at tea inside
      the room, and with the timidity of decent poverty everywhere he seemed
      glad to get a stranger out of his domestic groove.
    </p>
    <p>
      They crossed the street, entered the office, and went thence to an inner
      room. Here, after a short search, was found the book required. The precise
      address, not given in the condensed report that was printed, but written
      down by the reporter, was as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'ABRAHAM BROWN,
          LODGING-HOUSE KEEPER,
              41 CHARLES SQUARE,
                   HOXTON.'
</pre>
    <p>
      Owen copied it, and gave the reporter a small fee. 'I want to keep this
      inquiry private for the present,' he said hesitatingly. 'You will perhaps
      understand why, and oblige me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporter promised. 'News is shop with me,' he said, 'and to escape
      from handling it is my greatest social enjoyment.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evening, and the outer room of the publishing-office was lighted up
      with flaring jets of gas. After making the above remark, the reporter came
      out from the inner apartment in Graye's company, answering an expression
      of obligation from Owen with the words that it was no trouble. At the
      moment of his speech, he closed behind him the door between the two rooms,
      still holding his note-book in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the counter of the front room stood a tall man, who was also
      speaking, when they emerged. He said to the youth in attendance, 'I will
      take my paper for this week now I am here, so that you needn't post it to
      me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger then slightly turned his head, saw Owen, and recognized him.
      Owen passed out without recognizing the other as Manston.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston then looked at the reporter, who, after walking to the door with
      Owen, had come back again to lock up his books. Manston did not need to be
      told that the shabby marble-covered book which he held in his hand,
      opening endways and interleaved with blotting-paper, was an old
      reporting-book. He raised his eyes to the reporter's face, whose
      experience had not so schooled his features but that they betrayed a
      consciousness, to one half initiated as the other was, that his late
      proceeding had been connected with events in the life of the steward.
      Manston said no more, but, taking his newspaper, followed Owen from the
      office, and disappeared in the gloom of the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Springrove was now in London again, and on this same evening,
      before leaving Casterbridge, Owen wrote a careful letter to him, stating
      therein all the facts that had come to his knowledge, and begging him, as
      he valued Cytherea, to make cautious inquiries. A tall man was standing
      under the lamp-post, about half-a-dozen yards above the post-office, when
      he dropped the letter into the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same night, too, for a reason connected with the rencounter with Owen
      Graye, the steward entertained the idea of rushing off suddenly to London
      by the mail-train, which left Casterbridge at ten o'clock. But remembering
      that letters posted after the hour at which Owen had obtained his
      information&mdash;whatever that was&mdash;could not be delivered in London
      till Monday morning, he changed his mind and went home to Knapwater.
      Making a confidential explanation to his wife, arrangements were set on
      foot for his departure by the mail on Sunday night.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. MARCH THE ELEVENTH
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting for church the next morning several minutes earlier than was
      usual with him, the steward intentionally loitered along the road from the
      village till old Mr. Springrove overtook him. Manston spoke very civilly
      of the morning, and of the weather, asking how the farmer's barometer
      stood, and when it was probable that the wind might change. It was not in
      Mr. Springrove's nature&mdash;going to church as he was, too&mdash;to
      return anything but a civil answer to such civil questions, however his
      feelings might have been biassed by late events. The conversation was
      continued on terms of greater friendliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You must be feeling settled again by this time, Mr. Springrove, after the
      rough turn-out you had on that terrible night in November.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, but I don't know about feeling settled, either, Mr. Manston. The old
      window in the chimney-corner of the old house I shall never forget. No
      window in the chimney-corner where I am now, and I had been used to it for
      more than fifty years. Ted says 'tis a great loss to me, and he knows
      exactly what I feel.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your son is again in a good situation, I believe?' said Manston,
      imitating that inquisitiveness into the private affairs of the natives
      which passes for high breeding in country villages.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sir. I hope he'll keep it, or do something else and stick to it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis to be hoped he'll be steady now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's always been that, I assure 'ee,' said the old man tartly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;I mean intellectually steady. Intellectual wild oats
      will thrive in a soil of the strictest morality.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Intellectual gingerbread! Ted's steady enough&mdash;that's all I know
      about it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course&mdash;of course. Has he respectable lodgings? My own experience
      has shown me that that's a great thing to a young man living alone in
      London.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Warwick Street, Charing Cross&mdash;that's where he is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, to be sure&mdash;strange! A very dear friend of mine used to live
      at number fifty-two in that very same street.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Edward lives at number forty-nine&mdash;how very near being the same
      house!' said the old farmer, pleased in spite of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very,' said Manston. 'Well, I suppose we had better step along a little
      quicker, Mr. Springrove; the parson's bell has just begun.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Number forty-nine,' he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. MARCH THE TWELFTH
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward received Owen's letter in due time, but on account of his daily
      engagements he could not attend to any request till the clock had struck
      five in the afternoon. Rushing then from his office in Westminster, he
      called a hansom and proceeded to Hoxton. A few minutes later he knocked at
      the door of number forty-one, Charles Square, the old lodging of Mrs.
      Manston.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tall man who would have looked extremely handsome had he not been
      clumsily and closely wrapped up in garments that were much too elderly in
      style for his years, stood at the corner of the quiet square at the same
      instant, having, too, alighted from a cab, that had been driven along Old
      Street in Edward's rear. He smiled confidently when Springrove knocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody came to the door. Springrove knocked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brought out two people&mdash;one at the door he had been knocking
      upon, the other from the next on the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is Mr. Brown at home?' said Springrove.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'When will he be in?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite uncertain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Can you tell me where I may find him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. O, here he is coming, sir. That's Mr. Brown.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward looked down the pavement in the direction pointed out by the woman,
      and saw a man approaching. He proceeded a few steps to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward was impatient, and to a certain extent still a countryman, who had
      not, after the manner of city men, subdued the natural impulse to speak
      out the ruling thought without preface. He said in a quiet tone to the
      stranger, 'One word with you&mdash;do you remember a lady lodger of yours
      of the name of Mrs. Manston?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brown half closed his eyes at Springrove, somewhat as if he were
      looking into a telescope at the wrong end.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have never let lodgings in my life,' he said, after his survey.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Didn't you attend an inquest a year and a half ago, at Carriford?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never knew there was such a place in the world, sir; and as to lodgings,
      I have taken acres first and last during the last thirty years, but I have
      never let an inch.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose there is some mistake,' Edward murmured, and turned away. He
      and Mr. Brown were now opposite the door next to the one he had knocked
      at. The woman who was still standing there had heard the inquiry and the
      result of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I expect it is the other Mr. Brown, who used to live there, that you
      want, sir,' she said. 'The Mr. Brown that was inquired for the other day?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very likely that is the man,' said Edward, his interest reawakening.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He couldn't make a do of lodging-letting here, and at last he went to
      Cornwall, where he came from, and where his brother still lived, who had
      often asked him to come home again. But there was little luck in the
      change; for after London they say he couldn't stand the rainy west winds
      they get there, and he died in the December following. Will you step into
      the passage?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's unfortunate,' said Edward, going in. 'But perhaps you remember a
      Mrs. Manston living next door to you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes,' said the landlady, closing the door. 'The lady who was supposed
      to have met with such a horrible fate, and was alive all the time. I saw
      her the other day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Since the fire at Carriford?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. Her husband came to ask if Mr. Brown was still living here&mdash;just
      as you might. He seemed anxious about it; and then one evening, a week or
      fortnight afterwards, when he came again to make further inquiries, she
      was with him. But I did not speak to her&mdash;she stood back, as if she
      were shy. I was interested, however, for old Mr. Brown had told me all
      about her when he came back from the inquest.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you know Mrs. Manston before she called the other day?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. You see she was only Mr. Brown's lodger for two or three weeks, and I
      didn't know she was living there till she was near upon leaving again&mdash;we
      don't notice next-door people much here in London. I much regretted I had
      not known her when I heard what had happened. It led me and Mr. Brown to
      talk about her a great deal afterwards. I little thought I should see her
      alive after all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And when do you say they came here together?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't exactly remember the day&mdash;though I remember a very beautiful
      dream I had that same night&mdash;ah, I shall never forget it! Shoals of
      lodgers coming along the square with angels' wings and bright golden
      sovereigns in their hands wanting apartments at West End prices. They
      would not give any less; no, not if you&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. Did Mrs. Manston leave anything, such as papers, when she left these
      lodgings originally?' said Edward, though his heart sank as he asked. He
      felt that he was outwitted. Manston and his wife had been there before
      him, clearing the ground of all traces.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have always said "No" hitherto,' replied the woman, 'considering I
      could say no more if put upon my oath, as I expected to be. But speaking
      in a common everyday way now the occurrence is past, I believe a few
      things of some kind (though I doubt if they were papers) were left in a
      workbox she had, because she talked about it to Mr. Brown, and was rather
      angry at what occurred&mdash;you see, she had a temper by all account, and
      so I didn't like to remind the lady of this workbox when she came the
      other day with her husband.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And about the workbox?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, from what was casually dropped, I think Mrs. Manston had a few
      articles of furniture she didn't want, and when she was leaving they were
      put in a sale just by. Amongst her things were two workboxes very much
      alike. One of these she intended to sell, the other she didn't, and Mr.
      Brown, who collected the things together, took the wrong one to the sale.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What was in it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, nothing in particular, or of any value&mdash;some accounts, and her
      usual sewing materials I think&mdash;nothing more. She didn't take much
      trouble to get it back&mdash;she said the bills were worth nothing to her
      or anybody else, but that she should have liked to keep the box because
      her husband gave it her when they were first married, and if he found she
      had parted with it, he would be vexed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did Mrs. Manston, when she called recently with her husband, allude to
      this, or inquire for it, or did Mr. Manston?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No&mdash;and I rather wondered at it. But she seemed to have forgotten it&mdash;indeed,
      she didn't make any inquiry at all, only standing behind him, listening to
      his; and he probably had never been told anything about it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whose sale were these articles of hers taken to?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who was the auctioneer? Mr. Halway. His place is the third turning from
      the end of that street you see there. Anybody will tell you the shop&mdash;his
      name is written up.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward went off to follow up his clue with a promptness which was dictated
      more by a dogged will to do his utmost than by a hope of doing much. When
      he was out of sight, the tall and cloaked man, who had watched him, came
      up to the woman's door, with an appearance of being in breathless haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Has a gentleman been here inquiring about Mrs. Manston?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes; he's just gone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dear me! I want him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's gone to Mr. Halway's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think I can give him some information upon the subject. Does he pay
      pretty liberally?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He gave me half-a-crown.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That scale will do. I'm a poor man, and will see what my little
      contribution to his knowledge will fetch. But, by the way, perhaps you
      told him all I know&mdash;where she lived before coming to live here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I didn't know where she lived before coming here. O no&mdash;I only said
      what Mr. Brown had told me. He seemed a nice, gentle young man, or I
      shouldn't have been so open as I was.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall now about catch him at Mr. Halway's,' said the man, and went away
      as hastily as he had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward in the meantime had reached the auction-room. He found some
      difficulty, on account of the inertness of those whose only inducement to
      an action is a mere wish from another, in getting the information he stood
      in need of, but it was at last accorded him. The auctioneer's book gave
      the name of Mrs. Higgins, 3 Canley Passage, as the purchaser of the lot
      which had included Mrs. Manston's workbox.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thither Edward went, followed by the man. Four bell pulls, one above the
      other like waistcoat-buttons, appeared on the door-post. Edward seized the
      first he came to.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who did you woant?' said a thin voice from somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward looked above and around him; nobody was visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who did you woant?' said the thin voice again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found now that the sound proceeded from below the grating covering the
      basement window. He dropped his glance through the bars, and saw a child's
      white face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who did you woant?' said the voice the third time, with precisely the
      same languid inflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. Higgins,' said Edward.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Third bell up,' said the face, and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled the third bell from the bottom, and was admitted by another
      child, the daughter of the woman he was in search of. He gave the little
      thing sixpence, and asked for her mamma. The child led him upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Higgins was the wife of a carpenter who from want of employment one
      winter had decided to marry. Afterwards they both took to drink, and sank
      into desperate circumstances. A few chairs and a table were the chief
      articles of furniture in the third-floor back room which they occupied. A
      roll of baby-linen lay on the floor; beside it a pap-clogged spoon and an
      overturned tin pap-cup. Against the wall a Dutch clock was fixed out of
      level, and ticked wildly in longs and shorts, its entrails hanging down
      beneath its white face and wiry hands, like the faeces of a Harpy
      ('foedissima ventris proluvies, uncaeque manus, et pallida semper ora'). A
      baby was crying against every chair-leg, the whole family of six or seven
      being small enough to be covered by a washing-tub. Mrs. Higgins sat
      helpless, clothed in a dress which had hooks and eyes in plenty, but never
      one opposite the other, thereby rendering the dress almost useless as a
      screen to the bosom. No workbox was visible anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a depressing picture of married life among the very poor of a city.
      Only for one short hour in the whole twenty-four did husband and wife
      taste genuine happiness. It was in the evening, when, after the sale of
      some necessary article of furniture, they were under the influence of a
      quartern of gin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the ingenious and cruel satires that from the beginning till now
      have been stuck like knives into womankind, surely there is not one so
      lacerating to them, and to us who love them, as the trite old fact, that
      the most wretched of men can, in the twinkling of an eye, find a wife
      ready to be more wretched still for the sake of his company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward hastened to despatch his errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Higgins had lately pawned the workbox with other useless articles of
      lumber, she said. Edward bought the duplicate of her, and went downstairs
      to the pawnbroker's.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the back division of a musty shop, amid the heterogeneous collection of
      articles and odours invariably crowding such places, he produced his
      ticket, and with a sense of satisfaction out of all proportion to the
      probable worth of his acquisition, took the box and carried it off under
      his arm. He attempted to lift the cover as he walked, but found it locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dusk when Springrove reached his lodging. Entering his small
      sitting-room, the front apartment on the ground floor, he struck a light,
      and proceeded to learn if any scrap or mark within or upon his purchase
      rendered it of moment to the business in hand. Breaking open the cover
      with a small chisel, and lifting the tray, he glanced eagerly beneath, and
      found&mdash;nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He next discovered that a pocket or portfolio was formed on the underside
      of the cover. This he unfastened, and slipping his hand within, found that
      it really contained some substance. First he pulled out about a dozen
      tangled silk and cotton threads. Under them were a short household
      account, a dry moss-rosebud, and an old pair of carte-de-visite
      photographs. One of these was a likeness of Mrs. Manston&mdash;'Eunice'
      being written under it in ink&mdash;the other of Manston himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down dispirited. This was all the fruit of his task&mdash;not a
      single letter, date, or address of any kind to help him&mdash;and was it
      likely there would be?
    </p>
    <p>
      However, thinking he would send the fragments, such as they were, to
      Graye, in order to satisfy him that he had done his best so far, he
      scribbled a line, and put all except the silk and cotton into an envelope.
      Looking at his watch, he found it was then twenty minutes to seven; by
      affixing an extra stamp he would be enabled to despatch them by that
      evening's post. He hastily directed the packet, and ran with it at once to
      the post-office at Charing Cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return he took up the workbox again to examine it more leisurely.
      He then found there was also a small cavity in the tray under the
      pincushion, which was movable by a bit of ribbon. Lifting this he
      uncovered a flattened sprig of myrtle, and a small scrap of crumpled
      paper. The paper contained a verse or two in a man's handwriting. He
      recognized it as Manston's, having seen notes and bills from him at his
      father's house. The stanza was of a complimentary character, descriptive
      of the lady who was now Manston's wife.
    </p>

    <p>
      To shake, pull, and ransack the box till he had almost destroyed it was
      now his natural action. But it contained absolutely nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Disappointed again,' he said, flinging down the box, the bit of paper,
      and the withered twig that had lain with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet valueless as the new acquisition was, on second thoughts he considered
      that it would be worth while to make good the statement in his late note
      to Graye&mdash;that he had sent everything the box contained except the
      sewing-thread. Thereupon he enclosed the verse and myrtle-twig in another
      envelope, with a remark that he had overlooked them in his first search,
      and put it on the table for the next day's post.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his hurry and concentration upon the matter that occupied him,
      Springrove, on entering his lodging and obtaining a light, had not waited
      to pull down the blind or close the shutters. Consequently all that he had
      done had been visible from the street. But as on an average not one person
      a minute passed along the quiet pavement at this time of the evening, the
      discovery of the omission did not much concern his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the real state of the case was that a tall man had stood against the
      opposite wall and watched the whole of his proceeding. When Edward came
      out and went to the Charing Cross post-office, the man followed him and
      saw him drop the letter into the box. The stranger did not further trouble
      himself to follow Springrove back to his lodging again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston now knew that there had been photographs of some kind in his
      wife's workbox, and though he had not been near enough to see them, he
      guessed whose they were. The least reflection told him to whom they had
      been sent.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused a minute under the portico of the post-office, looking at the
      two or three omnibuses stopping and starting in front of him. Then he
      rushed along the Strand, through Holywell Street, and on to Old Boswell
      Court. Kicking aside the shoeblacks who began to importune him as he
      passed under the colonnade, he turned up the narrow passage to the
      publishing-office of the Post-Office Directory. He begged to be allowed to
      see the Directory of the south-west counties of England for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shopman immediately handed down the volume from a shelf, and Manston
      retired with it to the window-bench. He turned to the county, and then to
      the parish of Tolchurch. At the end of the historical and topographical
      description of the village he read:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Postmistress&mdash;Mrs. Hurston. Letters received at 6.30 A.M. by
      foot-post from Anglebury.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning his thanks, he handed back the book and quitted the office,
      thence pursuing his way to an obscure coffee-house by the Strand, where he
      now partook of a light dinner. But rest seemed impossible with him. Some
      absorbing intention kept his body continually on the move. He paid his
      bill, took his bag in his hand, and went out to idle about the streets and
      over the river till the time should have arrived at which the night-mail
      left the Waterloo Station, by which train he intended to return homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      There exists, as it were, an outer chamber to the mind, in which, when a
      man is occupied centrally with the most momentous question of his life,
      casual and trifling thoughts are just allowed to wander softly for an
      interval, before being banished altogether. Thus, amid his concentration
      did Manston receive perceptions of the individuals about him in the lively
      thoroughfare of the Strand; tall men looking insignificant; little men
      looking great and profound; lost women of miserable repute looking as
      happy as the days are long; wives, happy by assumption, looking careworn
      and miserable. Each and all were alike in this one respect, that they
      followed a solitary trail like the inwoven threads which form a banner,
      and all were equally unconscious of the significant whole they
      collectively showed forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o'clock he turned into Lancaster Place, crossed the river, and
      entered the railway-station, where he took his seat in the down
      mail-train, which bore him, and Edward Springrove's letter to Graye, far
      away from London.

      XVII. THE EVENTS OF ONE DAY
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1. MARCH THE THIRTEENTH. THREE TO SIX O'CLOCK A.M.
    </h3>
    <p>
      They entered Anglebury Station in the dead, still time of early morning,
      the clock over the booking-office pointing to twenty-five minutes to
      three. Manston lingered on the platform and saw the mail-bags brought out,
      noticing, as a pertinent pastime, the many shabby blotches of wax from
      innumerable seals that had been set upon their mouths. The guard took them
      into a fly, and was driven down the road to the post-office.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a raw, damp, uncomfortable morning, though, as yet, little rain was
      falling. Manston drank a mouthful from his flask and walked at once away
      from the station, pursuing his way through the gloom till he stood on the
      side of the town adjoining, at a distance from the last house in the
      street of about two hundred yards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The station road was also the turnpike-road into the country, the first
      part of its course being across a heath. Having surveyed the highway up
      and down to make sure of its bearing, Manston methodically set himself to
      walk backwards and forwards a stone's throw in each direction. Although
      the spring was temperate, the time of day, and the condition of suspense
      in which the steward found himself, caused a sensation of chilliness to
      pervade his frame in spite of the overcoat he wore. The drizzling rain
      increased, and drops from the trees at the wayside fell noisily upon the
      hard road beneath them, which reflected from its glassy surface the faint
      halo of light hanging over the lamps of the adjacent town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he walked and lingered for two hours, without seeing or hearing a
      living soul. Then he heard the market-house clock strike five, and soon
      afterwards, quick hard footsteps smote upon the pavement of the street
      leading towards him. They were those of the postman for the Tolchurch
      beat. He reached the bottom of the street, gave his bags a final hitch-up,
      stepped off the pavement, and struck out for the country with a brisk
      shuffle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston then turned his back upon the town, and walked slowly on. In two
      minutes a flickering light shone upon his form, and the postman overtook
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new-comer was a short, stooping individual of above five-and-forty,
      laden on both sides with leather bags large and small, and carrying a
      little lantern strapped to his breast, which cast a tiny patch of light
      upon the road ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A tryen mornen for travellers!' the postman cried, in a cheerful voice,
      without turning his head or slackening his trot.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is, indeed,' said Manston, stepping out abreast of him. 'You have a
      long walk every day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes&mdash;a long walk&mdash;for though the distance is only sixteen miles
      on the straight&mdash;that is, eight to the furthest place and eight back,
      what with the ins and outs to the gentlemen's houses, it makes
      two-and-twenty for my legs. Two-and-twenty miles a day, how many a year? I
      used to reckon it, but I never do now. I don't care to think o' my wear
      and tear, now it do begin to tell upon me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the conversation was begun, and the postman proceeded to narrate the
      different strange events that marked his experience. Manston grew very
      friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Postman, I don't know what your custom is,' he said, after a while; 'but
      between you and me, I always carry a drop of something warm in my pocket
      when I am out on such a morning as this. Try it.' He handed the bottle of
      brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you'll excuse me, please. I haven't took no stimmilents these five
      years.'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis never too late to mend.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Against the regulations, I be afraid.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who'll know it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's true&mdash;nobody will know it. Still, honesty's the best policy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah&mdash;it is certainly. But, thank God, I've been able to get on
      without it yet. You'll surely drink with me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Really, 'tis a'most too early for that sort o' thing&mdash;however, to
      oblige a friend, I don't object to the faintest shadder of a drop.' The
      postman drank, and Manston did the same to a very slight degree. Five
      minutes later, when they came to a gate, the flask was pulled out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well done!' said the postman, beginning to feel its effect; 'but guide my
      soul, I be afraid 'twill hardly do!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not unless 'tis well followed, like any other line you take up,' said
      Manston. 'Besides, there's a way of liking a drop of liquor, and of being
      good&mdash;even religious&mdash;at the same time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, for some thimble-and-button in-an-out fellers; but I could never get
      into the knack o' it; not I.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, you needn't be troubled; it isn't necessary for the higher class of
      mind to be religious&mdash;they have so much common-sense that they can
      risk playing with fire.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That hits me exactly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In fact, a man I know, who always had no other god but "Me;" and devoutly
      loved his neighbour's wife, says now that believing is a mistake.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, to be sure! However, believing in God is a mistake made by very few
      people, after all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A true remark.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not one Christian in our parish would walk half a mile in a rain like
      this to know whether the Scripture had concluded him under sin or grace.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nor in mine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, you may depend upon it they'll do away wi' Goddymity altogether afore
      long, although we've had him over us so many years.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's no knowing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I suppose the Queen 'ill be done away wi' then. A pretty concern
      that'll be! Nobody's head to put on your letters; and then your honest man
      who do pay his penny will never be known from your scamp who don't. O,
      'tis a nation!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Warm the cockles of your heart, however. Here's the bottle waiting.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll oblige you, my friend.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The drinking was repeated. The postman grew livelier as he went on, and at
      length favoured the steward with a song, Manston himself joining in the
      chorus.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          'He flung his mallet against the wall,
           Said, "The Lord make churches and chapels to fall,
           And there'll be work for tradesmen all!"
               When Joan's ale was new,
                               My boys,
               When Joan's ale was new.'
</pre>
    <p>
      'You understand, friend,' the postman added, 'I was originally a mason by
      trade: no offence to you if you be a parson?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'None at all,' said Manston.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain now came down heavily, but they pursued their path with alacrity,
      the produce of the several fields between which the lane wound its way
      being indicated by the peculiar character of the sound emitted by the
      falling drops. Sometimes a soaking hiss proclaimed that they were passing
      by a pasture, then a patter would show that the rain fell upon some
      large-leafed root crop, then a paddling plash announced the naked arable,
      the low sound of the wind in their ears rising and falling with each pace
      they took.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the small private bags of the county families, which were all
      locked, the postman bore the large general budget for the remaining
      inhabitants along his beat. At each village or hamlet they came to, the
      postman searched for the packet of letters destined for that place, and
      thrust it into an ordinary letter-hole cut in the door of the receiver's
      cottage&mdash;the village post-offices being mostly kept by old women who
      had not yet risen, though lights moving in other cottage windows showed
      that such people as carters, woodmen, and stablemen had long been
      stirring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The postman had by this time become markedly unsteady, but he still
      continued to be too conscious of his duties to suffer the steward to
      search the bag. Manston was perplexed, and at lonely points in the road
      cast his eyes keenly upon the short bowed figure of the man trotting
      through the mud by his side, as if he were half inclined to run a very
      great risk indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It frequently happened that the houses of farmers, clergymen, etc., lay a
      short distance up or down a lane or path branching from the direct track
      of the postman's journey. To save time and distance, at the point of
      junction of some of these paths with the main road, the gate-post was
      hollowed out to form a letter-box, in which the postman deposited his
      missives in the morning, looking in the box again in the evening to
      collect those placed there for the return post. Tolchurch Vicarage and
      Farmstead, lying back from the village street, were served on this
      principle. This fact the steward now learnt by conversing with the
      postman, and the discovery relieved Manston greatly, making his intentions
      much clearer to himself than they had been in the earlier stages of his
      journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had reached the outskirts of the village. Manston insisted upon the
      flask being emptied before they proceeded further. This was done, and they
      approached the church, the vicarage, and the farmhouse in which Owen and
      Cytherea were living.
    </p>
    <p>
      The postman paused, fumbled in his bag, took out by the light of his
      lantern some half-dozen letters, and tried to sort them. He could not
      perform the task.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We be crippled disciples a b'lieve,' he said, with a sigh and a stagger.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not drunk, but market-merry,' said Manston cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well done! If I baint so weak that I can't see the clouds&mdash;much less
      letters. Guide my soul, if so be anybody should tell the Queen's
      postmaster-general of me! The whole story will have to go through
      Parliament House, and I shall be high-treasoned&mdash;as safe as houses&mdash;and
      be fined, and who'll pay for a poor martel! O, 'tis a world!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Trust in the Lord&mdash;he'll pay.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He pay a b'lieve! why should he when he didn't drink the drink? He pay a
      b'lieve! D'ye think the man's a fool?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, well, I had no intention of hurting your feelings&mdash;but how was
      I to know you were so sensitive?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'True&mdash;you were not to know I was so sensitive. Here's a caddle wi'
      these letters! Guide my soul, what will Billy do!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston offered his services.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They are to be divided,' the man said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How?' said Manston.
    </p>
    <p>
      'These, for the village, to be carried on into it: any for the vicarage or
      vicarage farm must be left in the box of the gate-post just here. There's
      none for the vicarage-house this mornen, but I saw when I started there
      was one for the clerk o' works at the new church. This is it, isn't it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He held up a large envelope, directed in Edward Springrove's handwriting:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'MR. O. GRAYE,
          CLERK OF WORKS,
               TOLCHURCH,
                    NEAR ANGLEBURY.'
</pre>
    <p>
      The letter-box was scooped in an oak gate-post about a foot square. There
      was no slit for inserting the letters, by reason of the opportunity such a
      lonely spot would have afforded mischievous peasant-boys of doing damage
      had such been the case; but at the side was a small iron door, kept close
      by an iron reversible strap locked across it. One side of this strap was
      painted black, the other white, and white or black outwards implied
      respectively that there were letters inside, or none.
    </p>
    <p>
      The postman had taken the key from his pocket and was attempting to insert
      it in the keyhole of the box. He touched one side, the other, above,
      below, but never made a straight hit.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let me unlock it,' said Manston, taking the key from the postman. He
      opened the box and reached out with his other hand for Owen's letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no. O no&mdash;no,' the postman said. 'As one of&mdash;Majesty's
      servants&mdash;care&mdash;Majesty's mails&mdash;duty&mdash;put letters&mdash;own
      hands.' He slowly and solemnly placed the letter in the small cavity.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now lock it,' he said, closing the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steward placed the bar across, with the black side outwards,
      signifying 'empty,' and turned the key.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You've put the wrong side outwards!' said the postman. ''Tisn't empty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And dropped the key in the mud, so that I can't alter it,' said the
      steward, letting something fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What an awkward thing!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is an awkward thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They both went searching in the mud, which their own trampling had reduced
      to the consistency of pap, the postman unstrapping his little lantern from
      his breast, and thrusting it about, close to the ground, the rain still
      drizzling down, and the dawn so tardy on account of the heavy clouds that
      daylight seemed delayed indefinitely. The rays of the lantern were
      rendered individually visible upon the thick mist, and seemed almost
      tangible as they passed off into it, after illuminating the faces and
      knees of the two stooping figures dripping with wet; the postman's cape
      and private bags, and the steward's valise, glistening as if they had been
      varnished.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It fell on the grass,' said the postman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No; it fell in the mud,' said Manston. They searched again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm afraid we shan't find it by this light,' said the steward at length,
      washing his muddy fingers in the wet grass of the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm afraid we shan't,' said the other, standing up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll tell you what we had better do,' said Manston. 'I shall be back this
      way in an hour or so, and since it was all my fault, I'll look again, and
      shall be sure to find it in the daylight. And I'll hide the key here for
      you.' He pointed to a spot behind the post. 'It will be too late to turn
      the index then, as the people will have been here, so that the box had
      better stay as it is. The letter will only be delayed a day, and that will
      not be noticed; if it is, you can say you placed the iron the wrong way
      without knowing it, and all will be well.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This was agreed to by the postman as the best thing to be done under the
      circumstances, and the pair went on. They had passed the village and come
      to a crossroad, when the steward, telling his companion that their paths
      now diverged, turned off to the left towards Carriford.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner was the postman out of sight and hearing than Manston stalked
      back to the vicarage letter-box by keeping inside a fence, and thus
      avoiding the village; arrived here, he took the key from his pocket, where
      it had been concealed all the time, and abstracted Owen's letter. This
      done, he turned towards home, by the help of what he carried in his valise
      adjusting himself to his ordinary appearance as he neared the quarter in
      which he was known.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour and half's sharp walking brought him to his own door in Knapwater
      Park.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. EIGHT O'CLOCK A.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seated in his private office he wetted the flap of the stolen letter, and
      waited patiently till the adhesive gum could be loosened. He took out
      Edward's note, the accounts, the rosebud, and the photographs, regarding
      them with the keenest interest and anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      The note, the accounts, the rosebud, and his own photograph, he restored
      to their places again. The other photograph he took between his finger and
      thumb, and held it towards the bars of the grate. There he held it for
      half-a-minute or more, meditating.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is a great risk to run, even for such an end,' he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, impregnated with a bright idea, he jumped up and left the office
      for the front parlour. Taking up an album of portraits, which lay on the
      table, he searched for three or four likenesses of the lady who had so
      lately displaced Cytherea, which were interspersed among the rest of the
      collection, and carefully regarded them. They were taken in different
      attitudes and styles, and he compared each singly with that he held in his
      hand. One of them, the one most resembling that abstracted from the letter
      in general tone, size, and attitude, he selected from the rest, and
      returned with it to his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pouring some water into a plate, he set the two portraits afloat upon it,
      and sitting down tried to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of a quarter of an hour, after several ineffectual attempts, he
      found that each photograph would peel from the card on which it was
      mounted. This done, he threw into the fire the original likeness and the
      recent card, stuck upon the original card the recent likeness from the
      album, dried it before the fire, and placed it in the envelope with the
      other scraps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result he had obtained, then, was this: in the envelope were now two
      photographs, both having the same photographer's name on the back and
      consecutive numbers attached. At the bottom of the one which showed his
      own likeness, his own name was written down; on the other his wife's name
      was written; whilst the central feature, and whole matter to which this
      latter card and writing referred, the likeness of a lady mounted upon it,
      had been changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Manston entered the room, and begged him to come to breakfast. He
      followed her and they sat down. During the meal he told her what he had
      done, with scrupulous regard to every detail, and showed her the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is indeed a great risk to run,' she said, sipping her tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But it would be a greater not to do it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The envelope was again fastened up as before, and Manston put it in his
      pocket and went out. Shortly afterwards he was seen, on horseback, riding
      in a direction towards Tolchurch. Keeping to the fields, as well as he
      could, for the greater part of the way, he dropped into the road by the
      vicarage letter-box, and looking carefully about, to ascertain that no
      person was near, he restored the letter to its nook, placed the key in its
      hiding-place, as he had promised the postman, and again rode homewards by
      a roundabout way.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. AFTERNOON
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter was brought to Owen Graye, the same afternoon, by one of the
      vicar's servants who had been to the box with a duplicate key, as usual,
      to leave letters for the evening post. The man found that the index had
      told falsely that morning for the first time within his recollection; but
      no particular attention was paid to the mistake, as it was considered. The
      contents of the envelope were scrutinized by Owen and flung aside as
      useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning brought Springrove's second letter, the existence of
      which was unknown to Manston. The sight of Edward's handwriting again
      raised the expectations of brother and sister, till Owen had opened the
      envelope and pulled out the twig and verse.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing that's of the slightest use, after all,' he said to her; 'we are
      as far as ever from the merest shadow of legal proof that would convict
      him of what I am morally certain he did, marry you, suspecting, if not
      knowing, her to be alive all the time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What has Edward sent?' said Cytherea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'An old amatory verse in Manston's writing. Fancy,' he said bitterly,
      'this is the strain he addressed her in when they were courting&mdash;as
      he did you, I suppose.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He handed her the verse and she read&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                        'EUNICE.

          'Whoso for hours or lengthy days
           Shall catch her aspect's changeful rays,
           Then turn away, can none recall
           Beyond a galaxy of all
               In hazy portraiture;
           Lit by the light of azure eyes
           Like summer days by summer skies:
           Her sweet transitions seem to be
           A kind of pictured melody,
               And not a set contour.
                                      'AE. M.'
</pre>
    <p>
      A strange expression had overspread Cytherea's countenance. It rapidly
      increased to the most death-like anguish. She flung down the paper, seized
      Owen's hand tremblingly, and covered her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cytherea! What is it, for Heaven's sake?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Owen&mdash;suppose&mdash;O, you don't know what I think.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What?'
    </p>
    <p>
      '"<i>The light of azure eyes</i>,"' she repeated with ashy lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, "the light of azure eyes"?' he said, astounded at her manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs. Morris said in her letter to me that her eyes are <i>black</i>!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'H'm. Mrs. Morris must have made a mistake&mdash;nothing likelier.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She didn't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'They might be either in this photograph,' said Owen, looking at the card
      bearing Mrs. Manston's name.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Blue eyes would scarcely photograph so deep in tone as that,' said
      Cytherea. 'No, they seem black here, certainly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, then, Manston must have blundered in writing his verses.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But could he? Say a man in love may forget his own name, but not that he
      forgets the colour of his mistress's eyes. Besides she would have seen the
      mistake when she read them, and have had it corrected.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's true, she would,' mused Owen. 'Then, Cytherea, it comes to this&mdash;you
      must have been misinformed by Mrs. Morris, since there is no other
      alternative.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose I must.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her looks belied her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What makes you so strange&mdash;ill?' said Owen again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't believe Mrs. Morris wrong.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But look at this, Cytherea. If it is clear to us that the woman had blue
      eyes two years ago, she <i>must</i> have blue eyes now, whatever Mrs.
      Morris or anybody else may fancy. Any one would think that Manston could
      change the colour of a woman's eyes to hear you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' she said, and paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You say yes, as if he could,' said Owen impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      'By changing the woman herself,' she exclaimed. 'Owen, don't you see the
      horrid&mdash;what I dread?&mdash;that the woman he lives with is not Mrs.
      Manston&mdash;that she was burnt after all&mdash;and that I am <i>his wife</i>!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to support a stoicism under the weight of this new trouble, but
      no! The unexpected revulsion of ideas was so overwhelming that she crept
      to him and leant against his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before reflecting any further upon the subject Graye led her upstairs and
      got her to lie down. Then he went to the window and stared out of it up
      the lane, vainly endeavouring to come to some conclusion upon the
      fantastic enigma that confronted him. Cytherea's new view seemed
      incredible, yet it had such a hold upon her that it would be necessary to
      clear it away by positive proof before contemplation of her fear should
      have preyed too deeply upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cytherea,' he said, 'this will not do. You must stay here alone all the
      afternoon whilst I go to Carriford. I shall know all when I return.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no, don't go!' she implored.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Soon, then, not directly.' He saw her subtle reasoning&mdash;that it was
      folly to be wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reflection still convinced him that good would come of persevering in his
      intention and dispelling his sister's idle fears. Anything was better than
      this absurd doubt in her mind. But he resolved to wait till Sunday, the
      first day on which he might reckon upon seeing Mrs. Manston without
      suspicion. In the meantime he wrote to Edward Springrove, requesting him
      to go again to Mrs. Manston's former lodgings.

      XVIII. THE EVENTS OF THREE DAYS
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1. MARCH THE EIGHTEENTH
    </h3>
    <p>
      Sunday morning had come, and Owen was trudging over the six miles of hill
      and dale that lay between Tolchurch and Carriford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward Springrove's answer to the last letter, after expressing his
      amazement at the strange contradiction between the verses and Mrs.
      Morris's letter, had been to the effect that he had again visited the
      neighbour of the dead Mr. Brown, and had received as near a description of
      Mrs. Manston as it was possible to get at second-hand, and by hearsay. She
      was a tall woman, wide at the shoulders, and full-chested, and she had a
      straight and rather large nose. The colour of her eyes the informant did
      not know, for she had only seen the lady in the street as she went in or
      out. This confusing remark was added. The woman had almost recognized Mrs.
      Manston when she had called with her husband lately, but she had kept her
      veil down. Her residence, before she came to Hoxton, was quite unknown to
      this next-door neighbour, and Edward could get no manner of clue to it
      from any other source.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen reached the church-door a few minutes before the bells began chiming.
      Nobody was yet in the church, and he walked round the aisles. From
      Cytherea's frequent description of how and where herself and others used
      to sit, he knew where to look for Manston's seat; and after two or three
      errors of examination he took up a prayer-book in which was written
      'Eunice Manston.' The book was nearly new, and the date of the writing
      about a month earlier. One point was at any rate established: that the
      woman living with Manston was presented to the world as no other than his
      lawful wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quiet villagers of Carriford required no pew-opener in their place of
      worship: natives and in-dwellers had their own seats, and strangers sat
      where they could. Graye took a seat in the nave, on the north side, close
      behind a pillar dividing it from the north aisle, which was completely
      allotted to Miss Aldclyffe, her farmers, and her retainers, Manston's pew
      being in the midst of them. Owen's position on the other side of the
      passage was a little in advance of Manston's seat, and so situated that by
      leaning forward he could look directly into the face of any person sitting
      there, though, if he sat upright, he was wholly hidden from such a one by
      the intervening pillar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aiming to keep his presence unknown to Manston if possible, Owen sat,
      without once turning his head, during the entrance of the congregation. A
      rustling of silk round by the north passage and into Manston's seat, told
      him that some woman had entered there, and as it seemed from the
      accompaniment of heavier footsteps, Manston was with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately upon rising up, he looked intently in that direction, and saw
      a lady standing at the end of the seat nearest himself. Portions of
      Manston's figure appeared on the other side of her. In two glances Graye
      read thus many of her characteristics, and in the following order:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a tall woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was broad at the shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was full-bosomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was easily recognizable from the photograph but nothing could be
      discerned of the colour of her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a preoccupied mind he withdrew into his nook, and heard the service
      continued&mdash;only conscious of the fact that in opposition to the
      suspicion which one odd circumstance had bred in his sister concerning
      this woman, all ostensible and ordinary proofs and probabilities tended to
      the opposite conclusion. There sat the genuine original of the portrait&mdash;could
      he wish for more? Cytherea wished for more. Eunice Manston's eyes were
      blue, and it was necessary that this woman's eyes should be blue also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unskilled labour wastes in beating against the bars ten times the energy
      exerted by the practised hand in the effective direction. Owen felt this
      to be the case in his own and Edward's attempts to follow up the clue
      afforded them. Think as he might, he could not think of a crucial test in
      the matter absorbing him, which should possess the indispensable attribute&mdash;a
      capability of being applied privately; that in the event of its proving
      the lady to be the rightful owner of the name she used, he might recede
      without obloquy from an untenable position.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to see Mrs. Manston's eyes from where he sat was impossible, and he
      could do nothing in the shape of a direct examination at present. Miss
      Aldclyffe had possibly recognized him, but Manston had not, and feeling
      that it was indispensable to keep the purport of his visit a secret from
      the steward, he thought it would be as well, too, to keep his presence in
      the village a secret from him; at any rate, till the day was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first opening of the doors, Graye left the church and wandered away
      into the fields to ponder on another scheme. He could not call on Farmer
      Springrove, as he had intended, until this matter was set at rest. Two
      hours intervened between the morning and afternoon services.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time had nearly expired before Owen had struck out any method of
      proceeding, or could decide to run the risk of calling at the Old House
      and asking to see Mrs. Manston point-blank. But he had drawn near the
      place, and was standing still in the public path, from which a partial
      view of the front of the building could be obtained, when the bells began
      chiming for afternoon service. Whilst Graye paused, two persons came from
      the front door of the half-hidden dwelling whom he presently saw to be
      Manston and his wife. Manston was wearing his old garden-hat, and carried
      one of the monthly magazines under his arm. Immediately they had passed
      the gateway he branched off and went over the hill in a direction away
      from the church, evidently intending to ramble along, and read as the
      humour moved him. The lady meanwhile turned in the other direction, and
      went into the church path.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen resolved to make something of this opportunity. He hurried along
      towards the church, doubled round a sharp angle, and came back upon the
      other path, by which Mrs. Manston must arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      In about three minutes she appeared in sight without a veil. He
      discovered, as she drew nearer, a difficulty which had not struck him at
      first&mdash;that it is not an easy matter to particularize the colour of a
      stranger's eyes in a merely casual encounter on a path out of doors. That
      Mrs. Manston must be brought close to him, and not only so, but to look
      closely at him, if his purpose were to be accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shaped a plan. It might by chance be effectual; if otherwise, it would
      not reveal his intention to her. When Mrs. Manston was within speaking
      distance, he went up to her and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will you kindly tell me which turning will take me to Casterbridge?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The second on the right,' said Mrs. Manston.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen put on a blank look: he held his hand to his ear&mdash;conveying to
      the lady the idea that he was deaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came closer and said more distinctly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'The second turning on the right.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen flushed a little. He fancied he had beheld the revelation he was in
      search of. But had his eyes deceived him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more he used the ruse, still drawing nearer and intimating by a
      glance that the trouble he gave her was very distressing to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How very deaf!' she murmured. She exclaimed loudly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      '<i>The second turning to the right</i>.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She had advanced her face to within a foot of his own, and in speaking
      mouthed very emphatically, fixing her eyes intently upon his. And now his
      first suspicion was indubitably confirmed. Her eyes were as black as
      midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this feigning was most distasteful to Graye. The riddle having been
      solved, he unconsciously assumed his natural look before she had withdrawn
      her face. She found him to be peering at her as if he would read her very
      soul&mdash;expressing with his eyes the notification of which, apart from
      emotion, the eyes are more capable than any other&mdash;inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face changed its expression&mdash;then its colour. The natural tint of
      the lighter portions sank to an ashy gray; the pink of her cheeks grew
      purpler. It was the precise result which would remain after blood had left
      the face of one whose skin was dark, and artificially coated with
      pearl-powder and carmine.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head and moved away, murmuring a hasty reply to Owen's
      farewell remark of 'Good-day,' and with a kind of nervous twitch lifting
      her hand and smoothing her hair, which was of a light-brown colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She wears false hair,' he thought, 'or has changed its colour
      artificially. Her true hair matched her eyes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, in spite of what Mr. Brown's neighbours had said about nearly
      recognizing Mrs. Manston on her recent visit&mdash;which might have meant
      anything or nothing; in spite of the photograph, and in spite of his
      previous incredulity; in consequence of the verse, of her silence and
      backwardness at the visit to Hoxton with Manston, and of her appearance
      and distress at the present moment, Graye had a conviction that the woman
      was an impostor.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could be Manston's reason for such an astounding trick he could by no
      stretch of imagination divine.
    </p>
    <p>
      He changed his direction as soon as the woman was out of sight, and
      plodded along the lanes homeward to Tolchurch.
    </p>
    <p>
      One new idea was suggested to him by his desire to allay Cytherea's dread
      of being claimed, and by the difficulty of believing that the first Mrs.
      Manston lost her life as supposed, notwithstanding the inquest and
      verdict. Was it possible that the real Mrs. Manston, who was known to be a
      Philadelphian by birth, had returned by the train to London, as the porter
      had said, and then left the country under an assumed name, to escape that
      worst kind of widowhood&mdash;the misery of being wedded to a fickle,
      faithless, and truant husband?
    </p>
    <p>
      In her complicated distress at the news brought by her brother, Cytherea's
      thoughts at length reverted to her friend, the Rector of Carriford. She
      told Owen of Mr. Raunham's warm-hearted behaviour towards herself, and of
      his strongly expressed wish to aid her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He is not only a good, but a sensible man. We seem to want an old head on
      our side.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And he is a magistrate,' said Owen in a tone of concurrence. He thought,
      too, that no harm could come of confiding in the rector, but there was a
      difficulty in bringing about the confidence. He wished that his sister and
      himself might both be present at an interview with Mr. Raunham, yet it
      would be unwise for them to call on him together, in the sight of all the
      servants and parish of Carriford.
    </p>
    <p>
      There could be no objection to their writing him a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner was the thought born than it was carried out. They wrote to him
      at once, asking him to have the goodness to give them some advice they
      sadly needed, and begging that he would accept their assurance that there
      was a real justification for the additional request they made&mdash;that
      instead of their calling upon him, he would any evening of the week come
      to their cottage at Tolchurch.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. MARCH THE TWENTIETH. SIX TO NINE O'CLOCK P.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two evenings later, to the total disarrangement of his dinner-hour, Mr.
      Raunham appeared at Owen's door. His arrival was hailed with genuine
      gratitude. The horse was tied to the palings, and the rector ushered
      indoors and put into the easy-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Graye told him the whole story, reminding him that their first
      suspicions had been of a totally different nature, and that in
      endeavouring to obtain proof of their truth they had stumbled upon marks
      which had surprised them into these new uncertainties, thrice as
      marvellous as the first, yet more prominent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea's heart was so full of anxiety that it superinduced a manner of
      confidence which was a death-blow to all formality. Mr. Raunham took her
      hand pityingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is a serious charge,' he said, as a sort of original twig on which his
      thoughts might precipitate themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Assuming for a moment that such a substitution was rendered an easy
      matter by fortuitous events,' he continued, 'there is this consideration
      to be placed beside it&mdash;what earthly motive can Mr. Manston have had
      which would be sufficiently powerful to lead him to run such a very great
      risk? The most abandoned roue could not, at that particular crisis, have
      taken such a reckless step for the mere pleasure of a new companion.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen had seen that difficulty about the motive; Cytherea had not.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Unfortunately for us,' the rector resumed, 'no more evidence is to be
      obtained from the porter, Chinney. I suppose you know what became of him?
      He got to Liverpool and embarked, intending to work his way to America,
      but on the passage he fell overboard and was drowned. But there is no
      doubt of the truth of his confession&mdash;in fact, his conduct tends to
      prove it true&mdash;and no moral doubt of the fact that the real Mrs.
      Manston left here to go back by that morning's train. This being the case,
      then, why, if this woman is not she, did she take no notice of the
      advertisement&mdash;I mean not necessarily a friendly notice, but from the
      information it afforded her have rendered it impossible that she should be
      personified without her own connivance?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think that argument is overthrown,' Graye said, 'by my earliest
      assumption of her hatred of him, weariness of the chain which bound her to
      him, and a resolve to begin the world anew. Let's suppose she has married
      another man&mdash;somewhere abroad, say; she would be silent for her own
      sake.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You've hit the only genuine possibility,' said Mr. Raunham, tapping his
      finger upon his knee. 'That would decidedly dispose of the second
      difficulty. But his motive would be as mysterious as ever.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea's pictured dreads would not allow her mind to follow their
      conversation. 'She's burnt,' she said. 'O yes; I fear&mdash;I fear she
      is!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't think we can seriously believe that now, after what has
      happened,' said the rector.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still straining her thought towards the worst, 'Then, perhaps, the first
      Mrs. Manston was not his wife,' she returned; 'and then I should be his
      wife just the same, shouldn't I?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'They were married safely enough,' said Owen. 'There is abundance of
      circumstantial evidence to prove that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Upon the whole,' said Mr. Raunham, 'I should advise your asking in a
      straightforward way for legal proof from the steward that the present
      woman is really his original wife&mdash;a thing which, to my mind, you
      should have done at the outset.' He turned to Cytherea kindly, and asked
      her what made her give up her husband so unceremoniously.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not tell the rector of her aversion to Manston, and of her
      unquenched love for Edward.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your terrified state no doubt,' he said, answering for her, in the manner
      of those accustomed to the pulpit. 'But into such a solemn compact as
      marriage, all-important considerations, both legally and morally, enter;
      it was your duty to have seen everything clearly proved. Doubtless Mr.
      Manston is prepared with proofs, but as it concerns nobody but yourself
      that her identity should be publicly established (and by your absenteeism
      you act as if you were satisfied) he has not troubled to exhibit them.
      Nobody else has taken the trouble to prove what does not affect them in
      the least&mdash;that's the way of the world always. You, who should have
      required all things to be made clear, ran away.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That was partly my doing,' said Owen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same explanation&mdash;her want of love for Manston&mdash;applied here
      too, but she shunned the revelation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But never mind,' added the rector, 'it was all the greater credit to your
      womanhood, perhaps. I say, then, get your brother to write a line to Mr.
      Manston, saying you wish to be satisfied that all is legally clear (in
      case you should want to marry again, for instance), and I have no doubt
      that you will be. Or, if you would rather, I'll write myself?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O no, sir, no,' pleaded Cytherea, beginning to blanch, and breathing
      quickly. 'Please don't say anything. Let me live here with Owen. I am so
      afraid it will turn out that I shall have to go to Knapwater and be his
      wife, and I don't want to go. Do conceal what we have told you. Let him
      continue his deception&mdash;it is much the best for me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Raunham at length divined that her love for Manston, if it had ever
      existed, had transmuted itself into a very different feeling now.
    </p>
    <p>
      'At any rate,' he said, as he took his leave and mounted his mare, 'I will
      see about it. Rest content, Miss Graye, and depend upon it that I will not
      lead you into difficulty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Conceal it,' she still pleaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We'll see&mdash;but of course I must do my duty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No&mdash;don't do your duty!' She looked up at him through the gloom,
      illuminating her own face and eyes with the candle she held.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will consider, then,' said Mr. Raunham, sensibly moved. He turned his
      horse's head, bade them a warm adieu, and left the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rector of Carriford trotted homewards under the cold and clear March
      sky, its countless stars fluttering like bright birds. He was unconscious
      of the scene. Recovering from the effect of Cytherea's voice and glance of
      entreaty, he laid the subject of the interview clearly before himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suspicions of Cytherea and Owen were honest, and had foundation&mdash;that
      he must own. Was he&mdash;a clergyman, magistrate, and conscientious man&mdash;justified
      in yielding to Cytherea's importunities to keep silence, because she
      dreaded the possibility of a return to Manston? Was she wise in her
      request? Holding her present belief, and with no definite evidence either
      way, she could, for one thing, never conscientiously marry any one else.
      Suppose that Cytherea were Manston's wife&mdash;i.e., that the first wife
      was really burnt? The adultery of Manston would be proved, and, Mr.
      Raunham thought, cruelty sufficient to bring the case within the meaning
      of the statute. Suppose the new woman was, as stated, Mr. Manston's
      restored wife? Cytherea was perfectly safe as a single woman whose
      marriage had been void. And if it turned out that, though this woman was
      not Manston's wife, his wife was still living, as Owen had suggested, in
      America or elsewhere, Cytherea was safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first supposition opened up the worst contingency. Was she really safe
      as Manston's wife? Doubtful. But, however that might be, the gentle,
      defenceless girl, whom it seemed nobody's business to help or defend,
      should be put in a track to proceed against this man. She had but one
      life, and the superciliousness with which all the world now regarded her
      should be compensated in some measure by the man whose carelessness&mdash;to
      set him in the best light&mdash;had caused it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Raunham felt more and more positively that his duty must be done. An
      inquiry must be made into the matter. Immediately on reaching home, he sat
      down and wrote a plain and friendly letter to Mr. Manston, and despatched
      it at once to him by hand. Then he flung himself back in his chair, and
      went on with his meditation. Was there anything in the suspicion? There
      could be nothing, surely. Nothing is done by a clever man without a
      motive, and what conceivable motive could Manston have for such abnormal
      conduct? Corinthian that he might be, who had preyed on virginity like St.
      George's dragon, he would never have been absurd enough to venture on such
      a course for the possession alone of the woman&mdash;there was no reason
      for it&mdash;she was inferior to Cytherea in every respect, physical and
      mental.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, it seemed rather odd, when he analyzed the action, that
      a woman who deliberately hid herself from her husband for more than a
      twelvemonth should be brought back by a mere advertisement. In fact, the
      whole business had worked almost too smoothly and effectually for
      unpremeditated sequence. It was too much like the indiscriminate righting
      of everything at the end of an old play. And there was that curious
      business of the keys and watch. Her way of accounting for their being left
      behind by forgetfulness had always seemed to him rather forced. The only
      unforced explanation was that suggested by the newspaper writers&mdash;that
      she left them behind on purpose to blind people as to her escape, a motive
      which would have clashed with the possibility of her being fished back by
      an advertisement, as the present woman had been. Again, there were the two
      charred bones. He shuffled the books and papers in his study, and walked
      about the room, restlessly musing on the same subject. The parlour-maid
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Can young Mr. Springrove from London see you to-night, sir?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Young Mr. Springrove?' said the rector, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, sir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, of course he can see me. Tell him to come in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward came so impatiently into the room, as to show that the few short
      moments his announcement had occupied had been irksome to him. He stood in
      the doorway with the same black bag in his hand, and the same old gray
      cloak on his shoulders, that he had worn fifteen months earlier when
      returning on the night of the fire. This appearance of his conveyed a true
      impression; he had become a stagnant man. But he was excited now.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have this moment come from London,' he said, as the door was closed
      behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prophetic insight, which so strangely accompanies critical
      experiences, prompted Mr. Raunham's reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      'About the Grayes and Manston?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. That woman is not Mrs. Manston.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Prove it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can prove that she is somebody else&mdash;that her name is Anne
      Seaway.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And are their suspicions true indeed!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I can do what's more to the purpose at present.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Suggest Manston's motive?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Only suggest it, remember. But my assumption fits so perfectly with the
      facts that have been secretly unearthed and conveyed to me, that I can
      hardly conceive of another.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was in Edward's bearing that entire unconsciousness of himself
      which, natural to wild animals, only prevails in a sensitive man at
      moments of extreme intentness. The rector saw that he had no trivial story
      to communicate, whatever the story was.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sit down,' said Mr. Raunham. 'My mind has been on the stretch all the
      evening to form the slightest guess at such an object, and all to no
      purpose&mdash;entirely to no purpose. Have you said anything to Owen
      Graye?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing&mdash;nor to anybody. I could not trust to the effect a letter
      might have upon yourself, either; the intricacy of the case brings me to
      this interview.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst Springrove had been speaking the two had sat down together. The
      conversation, hitherto distinct to every corner of the room, was carried
      on now in tones so low as to be scarcely audible to the interlocutors, and
      in phrases which hesitated to complete themselves. Three-quarters of an
      hour passed. Then Edward arose, came out of the rector's study and again
      flung his cloak around him. Instead of going thence homeward, he went
      first to the Carriford Road Station with a telegram, having despatched
      which he proceeded to his father's house for the first time since his
      arrival in the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. FROM NINE TO TEN O'CLOCK P.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next presentation is the interior of the Old House on the evening of
      the preceding section. The steward was sitting by his parlour fire, and
      had been reading the letter arrived from the rectory. Opposite to him sat
      the woman known to the village and neighbourhood as Mrs. Manston.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Things are looking desperate with us,' he said gloomily. His gloom was
      not that of the hypochondriac, but the legitimate gloom which has its
      origin in a syllogism. As he uttered the words he handed the letter to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I almost expected some such news as this,' she replied, in a tone of much
      greater indifference. 'I knew suspicion lurked in the eyes of that young
      man who stared at me so in the church path: I could have sworn it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston did not answer for some time. His face was worn and haggard;
      latterly his head had not been carried so uprightly as of old. 'If they
      prove you to be&mdash;who you are.... Yes, if they do,' he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They must not find that out,' she said, in a positive voice, and looking
      at him. 'But supposing they do, the trick does not seem to me to be so
      serious as to justify that wretched, miserable, horrible look of yours. It
      makes my flesh creep; it is perfectly deathlike.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not reply, and she continued, 'If they say and prove that Eunice is
      indeed living&mdash;and dear, you know she is&mdash;she is sure to come
      back.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This remark seemed to awaken and irritate him to speech. Again, as he had
      done a hundred times during their residence together, he categorized the
      events connected with the fire at the Three Tranters. He dwelt on every
      incident of that night's history, and endeavoured, with an anxiety which
      was extraordinary in the apparent circumstances, to prove that his wife
      must, by the very nature of things, have perished in the flames. She arose
      from her seat, crossed the hearthrug, and set herself to soothe him; then
      she whispered that she was still as unbelieving as ever. 'Come, supposing
      she escaped&mdash;just supposing she escaped&mdash;where is she?' coaxed
      the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why are you so curious continually?' said Manston.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because I am a woman and want to know. Now where is she?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In the Flying Isle of San Borandan.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Witty cruelty is the cruellest of any. Ah, well&mdash;if she is in
      England, she will come back.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is not in England.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But she will come back?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, she won't.... Come, madam,' he said, arousing himself, 'I shall not
      answer any more questions.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah&mdash;ah&mdash;ah&mdash;she is not dead,' the woman murmured again
      poutingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She is, I tell you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't think so, love.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She was burnt, I tell you!' he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now to please me, admit the bare possibility of her being alive&mdash;just
      the possibility.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O yes&mdash;to please you I will admit that,' he said quickly. 'Yes, I
      admit the possibility of her being alive, to please you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him in utter perplexity. The words could only have been said
      in jest, and yet they seemed to savour of a tone the furthest remove from
      jesting. There was his face plain to her eyes, but no information of any
      kind was to be read there.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is only natural that I should be curious,' she murmured pettishly, 'if
      I resemble her as much as you say I do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are handsomer,' he said, 'though you are about her own height and
      size. But don't worry yourself. You must know that you are body and soul
      united with me, though you are but my housekeeper.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She bridled a little at the remark. 'Wife,' she said, 'most certainly
      wife, since you cannot dismiss me without losing your character and
      position, and incurring heavy penalties.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I own it&mdash;it was well said, though mistakenly&mdash;very
      mistakenly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't riddle to me about mistakenly and such dark things. Now what was
      your motive, dearest, in running the risk of having me here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your beauty,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She thanks you much for the compliment, but will not take it. Come, what
      was your motive?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your wit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no; not my wit. Wit would have made a wife of me by this time instead
      of what I am.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your virtue.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Or virtue either.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I tell you it was your beauty&mdash;really.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I cannot help seeing and hearing, and if what people say is true, I
      am not nearly so good-looking as Cytherea, and several years older.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The aspect of Manston's face at these words from her was so confirmatory
      of her hint, that his forced reply of 'O no,' tended to develop her
      chagrin.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mere liking or love for me,' she resumed, 'would not have sprung up all
      of a sudden, as your pretended passion did. You had been to London several
      times between the time of the fire and your marriage with Cytherea&mdash;you
      had never visited me or thought of my existence or cared that I was out of
      a situation and poor. But the week after you married her and were
      separated from her, off you rush to make love to me&mdash;not first to me
      either, for you went to several places&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, not several places.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, you told me so yourself&mdash;that you went first to the only
      lodging in which your wife had been known as Mrs. Manston, and when you
      found that the lodging-house-keeper had gone away and died, and that
      nobody else in the street had any definite ideas as to your wife's
      personal appearance, and came and proposed the arrangement we carried out&mdash;that
      I should personate her. Your taking all this trouble shows that something
      more serious than love had to do with the matter.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Humbug&mdash;what trouble after all did I take? When I found Cytherea
      would not stay with me after the wedding I was much put out at being left
      alone again. Was that unnatural?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And those favouring accidents you mention&mdash;that nobody knew my first
      wife&mdash;seemed an arrangement of Providence for our mutual benefit, and
      merely perfected a half-formed impulse&mdash;that I should call you my
      first wife to escape the scandal that would have arisen if you had come
      here as anything else.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My love, that story won't do. If Mrs. Manston was burnt, Cytherea, whom
      you love better than me, could have been compelled to live with you as
      your lawful wife. If she was not burnt, why should you run the risk of her
      turning up again at any moment and exposing your substitution of me, and
      ruining your name and prospects?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why&mdash;because I might have loved you well enough to run the risk
      (assuming her not to be burnt, which I deny).'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No&mdash;you would have run the risk the other way. You would rather have
      risked her finding you with Cytherea as a second wife, than with me as a
      personator of herself&mdash;the first one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You came easiest to hand&mdash;remember that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not so very easy either, considering the labour you took to teach me your
      first wife's history. All about how she was a native of Philadelphia. Then
      making me read up the guide-book to Philadelphia, and details of American
      life and manners, in case the birthplace and history of your wife, Eunice,
      should ever become known in this neighbourhood&mdash;unlikely as it was.
      Ah! and then about the handwriting of hers that I had to imitate, and the
      dying my hair, and rouging, to make the transformation complete? You mean
      to say that that was taking less trouble than there would have been in
      arranging events to make Cytherea believe herself your wife, and live with
      you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You were a needy adventuress, who would dare anything for a new pleasure
      and an easy life&mdash;and I was fool enough to give in to you&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good heavens above!&mdash;did I ask you to insert those advertisements
      for your old wife, and to make me answer it as if I was she? Did I ask you
      to send me the letter for me to copy and send back to you when the third
      advertisement appeared&mdash;purporting to come from the long-lost wife,
      and giving a detailed history of her escape and subsequent life&mdash;all
      which you had invented yourself? You deluded me into loving you, and then
      enticed me here! Ah, and this is another thing. How did you know the real
      wife wouldn't answer it, and upset all your plans?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because I knew she was burnt.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why didn't you force Cytherea to come back, then? Now, my love, I have
      caught you, and you may just as well tell first as last, <i>what was your
      motive in having me here as your first wife</i>?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Silence!' he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for the space of two minutes, and then persisted in going
      on to mutter, 'And why was it that Miss Aldclyffe allowed her favourite
      young lady, Cythie, to be overthrown and supplanted without an
      expostulation or any show of sympathy? Do you know I often think you
      exercise a secret power over Miss Aldclyffe. And she always shuns me as if
      I shared the power. A poor, ill-used creature like me sharing power,
      indeed!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She thinks you are Mrs. Manston.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That wouldn't make her avoid me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes it would,' he exclaimed impatiently. 'I wish I was dead&mdash;dead!'
      He had jumped up from his seat in uttering the words, and now walked
      wearily to the end of the room. Coming back more decisively, he looked in
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We must leave this place if Raunham suspects what I think he does,' he
      said. 'The request of Cytherea and her brother may simply be for a
      satisfactory proof, to make her feel legally free&mdash;but it may mean
      more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What may it mean?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How should I know?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, well, never mind, old boy,' she said, approaching him to make up
      the quarrel. 'Don't be so alarmed&mdash;anybody would think that you were
      the woman and I the man. Suppose they do find out what I am&mdash;we can
      go away from here and keep house as usual. People will say of you, "His
      first wife was burnt to death" (or "ran away to the Colonies," as the case
      may be); "He married a second, and deserted her for Anne Seaway." A very
      everyday case&mdash;nothing so horrible, after all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He made an impatient movement. 'Whichever way we do it, <i>nobody must
      know that you are not my wife Eunice</i>. And now I must think about
      arranging matters.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston then retired to his office, and shut himself up for the remainder
      of the evening.

      XIX. THE EVENTS OF A DAY AND NIGHT
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1. MARCH THE TWENTY-FIRST. MORNING
    </h3>
    <p>
      Next morning the steward went out as usual. He shortly told his companion,
      Anne, that he had almost matured their scheme, and that they would enter
      upon the details of it when he came home at night. The fortunate fact that
      the rector's letter did not require an immediate answer would give him
      time to consider.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne Seaway then began her duties in the house. Besides daily
      superintending the cook and housemaid one of these duties was, at rare
      intervals, to dust Manston's office with her own hands, a servant being
      supposed to disturb the books and papers unnecessarily. She softly
      wandered from table to shelf with the duster in her hand, afterwards
      standing in the middle of the room, and glancing around to discover if any
      noteworthy collection of dust had still escaped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eye fell upon a faint layer which rested upon the ledge of an
      old-fashioned chestnut cabinet of French Renaissance workmanship, placed
      in a recess by the fireplace. At a height of about four feet from the
      floor the upper portion of the front receded, forming the ledge alluded
      to, on which opened at each end two small doors, the centre space between
      them being filled out by a panel of similar size, making the third of
      three squares. The dust on the ledge was nearly on a level with the
      woman's eye, and, though insignificant in quantity, showed itself
      distinctly on account of this obliquity of vision. Now opposite the
      central panel, concentric quarter-circles were traced in the deposited
      film, expressing to her that this panel, too, was a door like the others;
      that it had lately been opened, and had skimmed the dust with its lower
      edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, then, her curiosity was slightly rewarded. For the right of the
      matter was that Anne had been incited to this exploration of Manston's
      office rather by a wish to know the reason of his long seclusion here,
      after the arrival of the rector's letter, and their subsequent discourse,
      than by any immediate desire for cleanliness. Still, there would have been
      nothing remarkable to Anne in this sight but for one recollection. Manston
      had once casually told her that each of the two side-lockers included half
      the middle space, the panel of which did not open, and was only put in for
      symmetry. It was possible that he had opened this compartment by
      candlelight the preceding night, or he would have seen the marks in the
      dust, and effaced them, that he might not be proved guilty of telling her
      an untruth. She balanced herself on one foot and stood pondering. She
      considered that it was very vexing and unfair in him to refuse her all
      knowledge of his remaining secrets, under the peculiar circumstances of
      her connection with him. She went close to the cabinet. As there was no
      keyhole, the door must be capable of being opened by the unassisted hand.
      The circles in the dust told her at which edge to apply her force. Here
      she pulled with the tips of her fingers, but the panel would not come
      forward. She fetched a chair and looked over the top of the cabinet, but
      no bolt, knob, or spring was to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, never mind,' she said, with indifference; 'I'll ask him about it, and
      he will tell me.' Down she came and turned away. Then looking back again
      she thought it was absurd such a trifle should puzzle her. She retraced
      her steps, and opened a drawer beneath the ledge of the cabinet, pushing
      in her hand and feeling about on the underside of the board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here she found a small round sinking, and pressed her finger into it.
      Nothing came of the pressure. She withdrew her hand and looked at the tip
      of her finger: it was marked with the impress of the circle, and, in
      addition, a line ran across it diametrically.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How stupid of me; it is the head of a screw.' Whatever mysterious
      contrivance had originally existed for opening the puny cupboard of the
      cabinet, it had at some time been broken, and this rough substitute
      provided. Stimulated curiosity would not allow her to recede now. She
      fetched a screwdriver, withdrew the screw, pulled the door open with a
      penknife, and found inside a cavity about ten inches square. The cavity
      contained&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Letters from different women, with unknown signatures, Christian names
      only (surnames being despised in Paphos). Letters from his wife Eunice.
      Letters from Anne herself, including that she wrote in answer to his
      advertisement. A small pocket-book. Sundry scraps of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letters from the strange women with pet names she glanced carelessly
      through, and then put them aside. They were too similar to her own
      regretted delusion, and curiosity requires contrast to excite it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letters from his wife were next examined. They were dated back as far
      as Eunice's first meeting with Manston, and the early ones before their
      marriage contained the usual pretty effusions of women at such a period of
      their existence. Some little time after he had made her his wife, and when
      he had come to Knapwater, the series began again, and now their contents
      arrested her attention more forcibly. She closed the cabinet, carried the
      letters into the parlour, reclined herself on the sofa, and carefully
      perused them in the order of their dates.

      'MY DEAR HUSBAND,&mdash;Why don't you write? Do you hate me? I have not
      had the heart to do anything this last week. That I, your wife, should be
      in this strait, and my husband well to do! I have been obliged to leave my
      first lodging for debt&mdash;among other things, they charged me for a lot
      of brandy which I am quite sure I did not taste. Then I went to Camberwell
      and was found out by them. I went away privately from thence, and changed
      my name the second time. I am now Mrs. Rondley. But the new lodging was
      the wretchedest and dearest I ever set foot in, and I left it after being
      there only a day. I am now at No. 20 in the same street that you left me
      in originally. All last night the sash of my window rattled so dreadfully
      that I could not sleep, but I had not energy enough to get out of bed to
      stop it. This morning I have been walking&mdash;I don't know how far&mdash;but
      far enough to make my feet ache. I have been looking at the outside of two
      or three of the theatres, but they seem forbidding if I regard them with
      the eye of an actress in search of an engagement. Though you said I was to
      think no more of the stage, I believe you would not care if you found me
      there. But I am not an actress by nature, and art will never make me one.
      I am too timid and retiring; I was intended for a cottager's wife. I
      certainly shall not try to go on the boards again whilst I am in this
      strange place. The idea of being brought on as far as London and then left
      here alone! Why didn't you leave me in Liverpool? Perhaps you thought I
      might have told somebody that my real name was Mrs. Manston. As if I had a
      living friend to whom I could impart it&mdash;no such good fortune! In
      fact, my nearest friend is no nearer than what most people would call a
      stranger. But perhaps I ought to tell you that a week before I wrote my
      last letter to you, after wishing that my uncle and aunt in Philadelphia
      (the only near relatives I had) were still alive, I suddenly resolved to
      send a line to my cousin James, who, I believe, is still living in that
      neighbourhood. He has never seen me since we were babies together. I did
      not tell him of my marriage, because I thought you might not like it, and
      I gave my real maiden name, and an address at the post-office here. But
      God knows if the letter will ever reach him.

      this time, so don't think I want to bore you of my own free-will. Who can

    <p>
      'DEAR COUSIN JAMES,&mdash;Thank you indeed for answering my letter so
      promptly. When I called at the post-office yesterday I did not in the
      least think there would be one. But I must leave this subject. I write
      again at once under the strangest and saddest conditions it is possible to
      conceive.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did not tell you in my last that I was a married woman. Don't blame me&mdash;it
      was my husband's influence. I hardly know where to begin my story. I had
      been living apart from him for a time&mdash;then he sent for me (this was
      last week) and I was glad to go to him. Then this is what he did. He
      promised to fetch me, and did not&mdash;leaving me to do the journey
      alone. He promised to meet me at the station here&mdash;he did not. I went
      on through the darkness to his house, and found his door locked and
      himself away from home. I have been obliged to come here, and I write to
      you in a strange room in a strange village inn! I choose the present
      moment to write to drive away my misery. Sorrow seems a sort of pleasure
      when you detail it on paper&mdash;poor pleasure though.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But this is what I want to know&mdash;and I am ashamed to tell it. I
      would gladly do as you say, and come to you as a housekeeper, but I have
      not the money even for a steerage passage. James, do you want me badly
      enough&mdash;do you pity me enough to send it? I could manage to subsist
      in London upon the proceeds of my sale for another month or six weeks.
      Will you send it to the same address at the post-office? But how do I know
      that you...'
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the letter ended. From creases in the paper it was plain that the
      writer, having got so far, had become dissatisfied with her production,
      and had crumpled it in her hand. Was it to write another, or not to write
      at all?
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing Anne Seaway perceived was that the fragmentary story she
      had coaxed out of Manston, to the effect that his wife had left England
      for America, might be truthful, according to two of these letters,
      corroborated by the evidence of the railway-porter. And yet, at first, he
      had sworn in a passion that his wife was most certainly consumed in the
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she had been burnt, this letter, written in her bedroom, and probably
      thrust into her pocket when she relinquished it, would have been burnt
      with her. Nothing was surer than that. Why, then, did he say she was
      burnt, and never show Anne herself this letter?
    </p>
    <p>
      The question suddenly raised a new and much stranger one&mdash;kindling a
      burst of amazement in her. How did Manston become possessed of this
      letter?
    </p>
    <p>
      That fact of possession was certainly the most remarkable revelation of
      all in connection with this epistle, and perhaps had something to do with
      his reason for never showing it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew by several proofs, that before his marriage with Cytherea, and up
      to the time of the porter's confession, Manston believed&mdash;honestly
      believed&mdash;that Cytherea would be his lawful wife, and hence, of
      course, that his wife Eunice was dead. So that no communication could
      possibly have passed between his wife and himself from the first moment
      that he believed her dead on the night of the fire, to the day of his
      wedding. And yet he had that letter. How soon afterwards could they have
      communicated with each other?
    </p>
    <p>
      The existence of the letter&mdash;as much as, or more than its contents&mdash;implying
      that Mrs. Manston was not burnt, his belief in that calamity must have
      terminated at the moment he obtained possession of the letter, if no
      earlier. Was, then, the only solution to the riddle that Anne could
      discern, the true one?&mdash;that he had communicated with his wife
      somewhere about the commencement of Anne's residence with him, or at any
      time since?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the most unlikely thing on earth that a woman who had forsaken her
      husband should countenance his scheme to personify her&mdash;whether she
      were in America, in London, or in the neighbourhood of Knapwater.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the old and harassing question, what was Manston's real motive
      in risking his name on the deception he was practising as regarded Anne.
      It could not be, as he had always pretended, mere passion. Her thoughts
      had reverted to Mr. Raunham's letter, asking for proofs of her identity
      with the original Mrs. Manston. She could see no loophole of escape for
      the man who supported her. True, in her own estimation, his worst
      alternative was not so very bad after all&mdash;the getting the name of
      libertine, a possible appearance in the divorce or some other court of
      law, and a question of damages. Such an exposure might hinder his worldly
      progress for some time. Yet to him this alternative was, apparently,
      terrible as death itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She restored the letters to their hiding-place, scanned anew the other
      letters and memoranda, from which she could gain no fresh information,
      fastened up the cabinet, and left everything in its former condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mind was ill at ease. More than ever she wished that she had never
      seen Manston. Where the person suspected of mysterious moral obliquity is
      the possessor of great physical and intellectual attractions, the mere
      sense of incongruity adds an extra shudder to dread. The man's strange
      bearing terrified Anne as it had terrified Cytherea; for with all the
      woman Anne's faults, she had not descended to such depths of depravity as
      to willingly participate in crime. She had not even known that a living
      wife was being displaced till her arrival at Knapwater put retreat out of
      the question, and had looked upon personation simply as a mode of
      subsistence a degree better than toiling in poverty and alone, after a
      bustling and somewhat pampered life as housekeeper in a gay mansion.

      2. AFTERNOON
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Raunham and Edward Springrove had by this time set in motion a
      machinery which they hoped to find working out important results.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rector was restless and full of meditation all the following morning.
      It was plain, even to the servants about him, that Springrove's
      communication wore a deeper complexion than any that had been made to the
      old magistrate for many months or years past. The fact was that, having
      arrived at the stage of existence in which the difficult intellectual feat
      of suspending one's judgment becomes possible, he was now putting it in
      practice, though not without the penalty of watchful effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not till the afternoon that he determined to call on his relative,
      Miss Aldclyffe, and cautiously probe her knowledge of the subject
      occupying him so thoroughly. Cytherea, he knew, was still beloved by this
      solitary woman. Miss Aldclyffe had made several private inquiries
      concerning her former companion, and there was ever a sadness in her tone
      when the young lady's name was mentioned, which showed that from whatever
      cause the elder Cytherea's renunciation of her favourite and namesake
      proceeded, it was not from indifference to her fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have you ever had any reason for supposing your steward anything but an
      upright man?' he said to the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never the slightest. Have you?' said she reservedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well&mdash;I have.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can say nothing plainly, because nothing is proved. But my suspicions
      are very strong.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you mean that he was rather cool towards his wife when they were first
      married, and that it was unfair in him to leave her? I know he was; but I
      think his recent conduct towards her has amply atoned for the neglect.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked Miss Aldclyffe full in the face. It was plain that she spoke
      honestly. She had not the slightest notion that the woman who lived with
      the steward might be other than Mrs. Manston&mdash;much less that a
      greater matter might be behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's not it&mdash;I wish it was no more. My suspicion is, first, that
      the woman living at the Old House is not Mr. Manston's wife.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not&mdash;Mr. Manston's wife?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That is it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe looked blankly at the rector. 'Not Mr. Manston's wife&mdash;who
      else can she be?' she said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      'An improper woman of the name of Anne Seaway.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Raunham had, in common with other people, noticed the extraordinary
      interest of Miss Aldclyffe in the well-being of her steward, and had
      endeavoured to account for it in various ways. The extent to which she was
      shaken by his information, whilst it proved that the understanding between
      herself and Manston did not make her a sharer of his secrets, also showed
      that the tie which bound her to him was still unbroken. Mr. Raunham had
      lately begun to doubt the latter fact, and now, on finding himself
      mistaken, regretted that he had not kept his own counsel in the matter.
      This it was too late to do, and he pushed on with his proofs. He gave Miss
      Aldclyffe in detail the grounds of his belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he had done, she recovered the cloak of reserve that she had
      adopted on his opening the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I might possibly be convinced that you were in the right, after such an
      elaborate argument,' she replied, 'were it not for one fact, which bears
      in the contrary direction so pointedly, that nothing but absolute proof
      can turn it. It is that there is no conceivable motive which could induce
      any sane man&mdash;leaving alone a man of Mr. Manston's clear-headedness
      and integrity&mdash;to venture upon such an extraordinary course of
      conduct&mdash;no motive on earth.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That was my own opinion till after the visit of a friend last night&mdash;a
      friend of mine and poor little Cytherea's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah&mdash;and Cytherea,' said Miss Aldclyffe, catching at the idea raised
      by the name. 'That he loved Cytherea&mdash;yes and loves her now, wildly
      and devotedly, I am as positive as that I breathe. Cytherea is years
      younger than Mrs. Manston&mdash;as I shall call her&mdash;twice as sweet
      in disposition, three times as beautiful. Would he have given her up
      quietly and suddenly for a common&mdash;Mr. Raunham, your story is
      monstrous, and I don't believe it!' She glowed in her earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rector might now have advanced his second proposition&mdash;the
      possible motive&mdash;but for reasons of his own he did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well, madam. I only hope that facts will sustain you in your belief.
      Ask him the question to his face, whether the woman is his wife or no, and
      see how he receives it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will to-morrow, most certainly,' she said. 'I always let these things
      die of wholesome ventilation, as every fungus does.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But no sooner had the rector left her presence, than the grain of
      mustard-seed he had sown grew to a tree. Her impatience to set her mind at
      rest could not brook a night's delay. It was with the utmost difficulty
      that she could wait till evening arrived to screen her movements.
      Immediately the sun had dropped behind the horizon, and before it was
      quite dark, she wrapped her cloak around her, softly left the house, and
      walked erect through the gloomy park in the direction of the old
      manor-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same minute saw two persons sit down in the rectory-house to share the
      rector's usually solitary dinner. One was a man of official appearance,
      commonplace in all except his eyes. The other was Edward Springrove.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discovery of the carefully-concealed letters rankled in the mind of
      Anne Seaway. Her woman's nature insisted that Manston had no right to keep
      all matters connected with his lost wife a secret from herself. Perplexity
      had bred vexation; vexation, resentment; curiosity had been continuous.
      The whole morning this resentment and curiosity increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steward said very little to his companion during their luncheon at
      mid-day. He seemed reckless of appearances&mdash;almost indifferent to
      whatever fate awaited him. All his actions betrayed that something
      portentous was impending, and still he explained nothing. By carefully
      observing every trifling action, as only a woman can observe them, the
      thought at length dawned upon her that he was going to run away secretly.
      She feared for herself; her knowledge of law and justice was vague, and
      she fancied she might in some way be made responsible for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoon he went out of the house again, and she watched him drive
      away in the direction of the county-town. She felt a desire to go there
      herself, and, after an interval of half-an-hour, followed him on foot
      notwithstanding the distance&mdash;ostensibly to do some shopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      One among her several trivial errands was to make a small purchase at the
      druggist's. Near the druggist's stood the County Bank. Looking out of the
      shop window, between the coloured bottles, she saw Manston come down the
      steps of the bank, in the act of withdrawing his hand from his pocket, and
      pulling his coat close over its mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an almost universal habit with people, when leaving a bank, to be
      carefully adjusting their pockets if they have been receiving money; if
      they have been paying it in, their hands swing laxly. The steward had in
      all likelihood been taking money&mdash;possibly on Miss Aldclyffe's
      account&mdash;that was continual with him. And he might have been removing
      his own, as a man would do who was intending to leave the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. FROM FIVE TO EIGHT O'CLOCK P.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne reached home again in time to preside over preparations for dinner.
      Manston came in half-an-hour later. The lamp was lighted, the shutters
      were closed, and they sat down together. He was pale and worn&mdash;almost
      haggard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meal passed off in almost unbroken silence. When preoccupation
      withstands the influence of a social meal with one pleasant companion, the
      mental scene must be surpassingly vivid. Just as she was rising a tap came
      to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before a maid could attend to the knock, Manston crossed the room and
      answered it himself. The visitor was Miss Aldclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston instantly came back and spoke to Anne in an undertone. 'I should
      be glad if you could retire to your room for a short time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is a dry, starlight evening,' she replied. 'I will go for a little
      walk if your object is merely a private conversation with Miss Aldclyffe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well, do; there's no accounting for tastes,' he said. A few
      commonplaces then passed between her and Miss Aldclyffe, and Anne went
      upstairs to bonnet and cloak herself. She came down, opened the front
      door, and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked around to realize the night. It was dark, mournful, and quiet.
      Then she stood still. From the moment that Manston had requested her
      absence, a strong and burning desire had prevailed in her to know the
      subject of Miss Aldclyffe's conversation with him. Simple curiosity was
      not entirely what inspired her. Her suspicions had been thoroughly aroused
      by the discovery of the morning. A conviction that her future depended on
      her power to combat a man who, in desperate circumstances, would be far
      from a friend to her, prompted a strategic movement to acquire the
      important secret that was in handling now. The woman thought and thought,
      and regarded the dull dark trees, anxiously debating how the thing could
      be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stealthily re-opening the front door she entered the hall, and advancing
      and pausing alternately, came close to the door of the room in which Miss
      Aldclyffe and Manston conversed. Nothing could be heard through the
      keyhole or panels. At a great risk she softly turned the knob and opened
      the door to a width of about half-an-inch, performing the act so
      delicately that three minutes, at least, were occupied in completing it.
      At that instant Miss Aldclyffe said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's a draught somewhere. The door is ajar, I think.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne glided back under the staircase. Manston came forward and closed the
      door. This chance was now cut off, and she considered again. The parlour,
      or sitting-room, in which the conference took place, had the
      window-shutters fixed on the outside of the window, as is usual in the
      back portions of old country-houses. The shutters were hinged one on each
      side of the opening, and met in the middle, where they were fastened by a
      bolt passing continuously through them and the wood mullion within, the
      bolt being secured on the inside by a pin, which was seldom inserted till
      Manston and herself were about to retire for the night; sometimes not at
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she returned to the door of the room she might be discovered at any
      moment, but could she listen at the window, which overlooked a part of the
      garden never visited after nightfall, she would be safe from disturbance.
      The idea was worth a trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glided round to the window, took the head of the bolt between her
      finger and thumb, and softly screwed it round until it was entirely
      withdrawn from its position. The shutters remained as before, whilst,
      where the bolt had come out, was now a shining hole three-quarters of an
      inch in diameter, through which one might see into the middle of the room.
      She applied her eye to the orifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe and Manston were both standing; Manston with his back to
      the window, his companion facing it. The lady's demeanour was severe,
      condemnatory, and haughty. No more was to be seen; Anne then turned
      sideways, leant with her shoulder against the shutters and placed her ear
      upon the hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You know where,' said Miss Aldclyffe. 'And how could you, a man, act a
      double deceit like this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Men do strange things sometimes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What was your reason&mdash;come?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A mere whim.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I might even believe that, if the woman were handsomer than Cytherea, or
      if you had been married some time to Cytherea and had grown tired of her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And can't you believe it, too, under these conditions; that I married
      Cytherea, gave her up because I heard that my wife was alive, found that
      my wife would not come to live with me, and then, not to let any woman I
      love so well as Cytherea run any risk of being displaced and ruined in
      reputation, should my wife ever think fit to return, induced this woman to
      come to me, as being better than no companion at all?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I cannot believe it. Your love for Cytherea was not of such a kind as
      that excuse would imply. It was Cytherea or nobody with you. As an object
      of passion, you did not desire the company of this Anne Seaway at all, and
      certainly not so much as to madly risk your reputation by bringing her
      here in the way you have done. I am sure you didn't, AEneas.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So am I,' he said bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe uttered an exclamation of astonishment; the confession was
      like a blow in its suddenness. She began to reproach him bitterly, and
      with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How could you overthrow my plans, disgrace the only girl I ever had any
      respect for, by such inexplicable doings!... That woman must leave this
      place&mdash;the country perhaps. Heavens! the truth will leak out in a day
      or two!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She must do no such thing, and the truth must be stifled somehow&mdash;nobody
      knows how. If I stay here, or on any spot of the civilized globe, as
      AEneas Manston, this woman must live with me as my wife, or I am damned
      past redemption!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will not countenance your keeping her, whatever your motive may be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You must do something,' he murmured. 'You must. Yes, you must.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I never will,' she said. 'It is a criminal act.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her earnestly. 'Will you not support me through this
      deception if my very life depends upon it? Will you not?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nonsense! Life! It will be a scandal to you, but she must leave this
      place. It will out sooner or later, and the exposure had better come now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston repeated gloomily the same words. 'My life depends upon your
      supporting me&mdash;my very life.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He then came close to her, and spoke into her ear. Whilst he spoke he held
      her head to his mouth with both his hands. Strange expressions came over
      her face; the workings of her mouth were painful to observe. Still he held
      her and whispered on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only words that could be caught by Anne Seaway, confused as her
      hearing frequently was by the moan of the wind and the waterfall in her
      outer ear, were these of Miss Aldclyffe, in tones which absolutely
      quivered: 'They have no money. What can they prove?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The listener tasked herself to the utmost to catch his answer, but it was
      in vain. Of the remainder of the colloquy one fact alone was plain to
      Anne, and that only inductively&mdash;that Miss Aldclyffe, from what he
      had revealed to her, was going to scheme body and soul on Manston's
      behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe seemed now to have no further reason for remaining, yet she
      lingered awhile as if loth to leave him. When, finally, the crestfallen
      and agitated lady made preparations for departure, Anne quickly inserted
      the bolt, ran round to the entrance archway, and down the steps into the
      park. Here she stood close to the trunk of a huge lime-tree, which
      absorbed her dark outline into its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes she saw Manston, with Miss Aldclyffe leaning on his arm,
      cross the glade before her and proceed in the direction of the house. She
      watched them ascend the rise and advance, as two black spots, towards the
      mansion. The appearance of an oblong space of light in the dark mass of
      walls denoted that the door was opened. Miss Aldclyffe's outline became
      visible upon it; the door shut her in, and all was darkness again. The
      form of Manston returning alone arose from the gloom, and passed by Anne
      in her hiding-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Waiting outside a quarter of an hour longer, that no suspicion of any kind
      might be excited, Anne returned to the old manor-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. FROM EIGHT TO ELEVEN O'CLOCK P.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston was very friendly that evening. It was evident to her, now that
      she was behind the scenes, that he was making desperate efforts to
      disguise the real state of his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her terror of him did not decrease. They sat down to supper, Manston still
      talking cheerfully. But what is keener than the eye of a mistrustful
      woman? A man's cunning is to it as was the armour of Sisera to the thin
      tent-nail. She found, in spite of his adroitness, that he was attempting
      something more than a disguise of his feeling. He was trying to distract
      her attention, that he might be unobserved in some special movement of his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a moment it was for her then! The whole surface of her body became
      attentive. She allowed him no chance whatever. We know the duplicated
      condition at such times&mdash;when the existence divides itself into two,
      and the ostensibly innocent chatterer stands in front, like another
      person, to hide the timorous spy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston played the same game, but more palpably. The meal was nearly over
      when he seemed possessed of a new idea of how his object might be
      accomplished. He tilted back his chair with a reflective air, and looked
      steadily at the clock standing against the wall opposite to him. He said
      sententiously, 'Few faces are capable of expressing more by dumb show than
      the face of a clock. You may see in it every variety of incentive&mdash;from
      the softest seductions to negligence to the strongest hints for action.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, in what way?' she inquired. His drift was, as yet, quite
      unintelligible to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, for instance: look at the cold, methodical, unromantic,
      business-like air of all the right-angled positions of the hands. They
      make a man set about work in spite of himself. Then look at the piquant
      shyness of its face when the two hands are over each other. Several
      attitudes imply "Make ready." The "make ready" of ten minutes to one
      differs from the "make ready" of ten minutes to twelve, as youth differs
      from age. "Upward and onward" says twenty-five minutes to eleven. Mid-day
      or midnight expresses distinctly "It is done." You surely have noticed
      that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I have.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued with affected quaintness:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'The easy dash of ten minutes past seven, the rakish recklessness of a
      quarter past, the drooping weariness of twenty-five minutes past, must
      have been observed by everybody.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whatever amount of truth there may be, there is a good deal of
      imagination in your fancy,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He still contemplated the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then, again, the general finish of the face has a great effect upon the
      eye. This old-fashioned brass-faced one we have here, with its arched top,
      half-moon slit for the day of the month, and ship rocking at the upper
      part, impresses me with the notion of its being an old cynic, elevating
      his brows, whose thoughts can be seen wavering between good and evil.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A thought now enlightened her: the clock was behind her, and he wanted to
      get her back turned. She dreaded turning, yet, not to excite his
      suspicion, she was on her guard; she quickly looked behind her at the
      clock as he spoke, recovering her old position again instantly. The time
      had not been long enough for any action whatever on his part.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah,' he casually remarked, and at the same minute began to pour her out a
      glass of wine. 'Speaking of the clock has reminded me that it must nearly
      want winding up. Remember that it is wound to-night. Suppose you do it at
      once, my dear.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no possible way of evading the act. She resolutely turned to
      perform the operation: anything was better than that he should suspect
      her. It was an old-fashioned eight-day clock, of workmanship suited to the
      rest of the antique furniture that Manston had collected there, and ground
      heavily during winding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne had given up all idea of being able to watch him during the interval,
      and the noise of the wheels prevented her learning anything by her ears.
      But, as she wound, she caught sight of his shadow on the wall at her right
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was he doing? He was in the very act of pouring something into her
      glass of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had completed the manoeuvre before she had done winding. She
      methodically closed the clock-case and turned round again. When she faced
      him he was sitting in his chair as before she had risen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a familiar scene which has hitherto been pleasant it is difficult to
      realize that an added condition, which does not alter its aspect, can have
      made it terrible. The woman thought that his action must have been
      prompted by no other intent than that of poisoning her, and yet she could
      not instantly put on a fear of her position.
    </p>
    <p>
      And before she had grasped these consequences, another supposition served
      to make her regard the first as unlikely, if not absurd. It was the act of
      a madman to take her life in a manner so easy of discovery, unless there
      were far more reason for the crime than any that Manston could possibly
      have.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it not merely his intention, in tampering with her wine, to make her
      sleep soundly that night? This was in harmony with her original suspicion,
      that he intended secretly to abscond. At any rate, he was going to set
      about some stealthy proceeding, as to which she was to be kept in utter
      darkness. The difficulty now was to avoid drinking the wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      By means of one pretext and another she put off taking her glass for
      nearly five minutes, but he eyed her too frequently to allow her to throw
      the potion under the grate. It became necessary to take one sip. This she
      did, and found an opportunity of absorbing it in her handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plainly he had no idea of her countermoves. The scheme seemed to him in
      proper train, and he turned to poke out the fire. She instantly seized the
      glass, and poured its contents down her bosom. When he faced round again
      she was holding the glass to her lips, empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      In due course he locked the doors and saw that the shutters were fastened.
      She attended to a few closing details of housewifery, and a few minutes
      later they retired for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. FROM ELEVEN O'CLOCK TO MIDNIGHT
    </p>
    <p>
      When Manston was persuaded, by the feigned heaviness of her breathing,
      that Anne Seaway was asleep, he softly arose, and dressed himself in the
      gloom. With ears strained to their utmost she heard him complete this
      operation; then he took something from his pocket, put it in the drawer of
      the dressing-table, went to the door, and down the stairs. She glided out
      of bed and looked in the drawer. He had only restored to its place a small
      phial she had seen there before. It was labelled 'Battley's Solution of
      Opium.' She felt relieved that her life had not been attempted. That was
      to have been her sleeping-draught. No time was to be lost if she meant to
      be a match for him. She followed him in her nightdress. When she reached
      the foot of the staircase he was in the office and had closed the door,
      under which a faint gleam showed that he had obtained a light. She crept
      to the door, but could not venture to open it, however slightly. Placing
      her ear to the panel, she could hear him tearing up papers of some sort,
      and a brighter and quivering ray of light coming from the threshold an
      instant later, implied that he was burning them. By the slight noise of
      his footsteps on the uncarpeted floor, she at length imagined that he was
      approaching the door. She flitted upstairs again and crept into bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston returned to the bedroom close upon her heels, and entered it&mdash;again
      without a light. Standing motionless for an instant to assure himself that
      she still slept, he went to the drawer in which their ready-money was
      kept, and removed the casket that contained it. Anne's ear distinctly
      caught the rustle of notes, and the chink of the gold as he handled it.
      Some he placed in his pocket, some he returned to its place. He stood
      thinking, as it were weighing a possibility. While lingering thus, he
      noticed the reflected image of his own face in the glass&mdash;pale and
      spectre-like in its indistinctness. The sight seemed to be the feather
      which turned the balance of indecision: he drew a heavy breath, retired
      from the room, and passed downstairs. She heard him unbar the back-door,
      and go out into the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling safe in a conclusion that he did not intend to return to the
      bedroom again, she arose, and hastily dressed herself. On going to the
      door of the apartment she found that he had locked it behind him. 'A
      precaution&mdash;it can be no more,' she muttered. Yet she was all the
      more perplexed and excited on this account. Had he been going to leave
      home immediately, he would scarcely have taken the trouble to lock her in,
      holding the belief that she was in a drugged sleep. The lock shot into a
      mortice, so that there was no possibility of her pushing back the bolt.
      How should she follow him? Easily. An inner closet opened from the
      bedroom: it was large, and had some time heretofore been used as a
      dressing or bath room, but had been found inconvenient from having no
      other outlet to the landing. The window of this little room looked out
      upon the roof of the porch, which was flat and covered with lead. Anne
      took a pillow from the bed, gently opened the casement of the inner room
      and stepped forth on the flat. There, leaning over the edge of the small
      parapet that ornamented the porch, she dropped the pillow upon the gravel
      path, and let herself down over the parapet by her hands till her toes
      swung about two feet from the ground. From this position she adroitly
      alighted upon the pillow, and stood in the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since she had come indoors from her walk in the early part of the evening
      the moon had risen. But the thick clouds overspreading the whole landscape
      rendered the dim light pervasive and grey: it appeared as an attribute of
      the air. Anne crept round to the back of the house, listening intently.
      The steward had had at least ten minutes' start of her. She had waited
      here whilst one might count fifty, when she heard a movement in the
      outhouse&mdash;a fragment once attached to the main building. This
      outhouse was partitioned into an outer and an inner room, which had been a
      kitchen and a scullery before the connecting erections were pulled down,
      but they were now used respectively as a brewhouse and workshop, the only
      means of access to the latter being through the brewhouse. The outer door
      of this first apartment was usually fastened by a padlock on the exterior.
      It was now closed, but not fastened. Manston was evidently in the
      outhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slightly moved the door. The interior of the brewhouse was wrapped in
      gloom, but a streak of light fell towards her in a line across the floor
      from the inner or workshop door, which was not quite closed. This light
      was unexpected, none having been visible through hole or crevice. Glancing
      in, the woman found that he had placed cloths and mats at the various
      apertures, and hung a sack at the window to prevent the egress of a single
      ray. She could also perceive from where she stood that the bar of light
      fell across the brewing-copper just outside the inner door, and that upon
      it lay the key of her bedroom. The illuminated interior of the workshop
      was also partly visible from her position through the two half-open doors.
      Manston was engaged in emptying a large cupboard of the tools, gallipots,
      and old iron it contained. When it was quite cleared he took a chisel, and
      with it began to withdraw the hooks and shoulder-nails holding the
      cupboard to the wall. All these being loosened, he extended his arms,
      lifted the cupboard bodily from the brackets under it, and deposited it on
      the floor beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That portion of the wall which had been screened by the cupboard was now
      laid bare. This, it appeared, had been plastered more recently than the
      bulk of the outhouse. Manston loosened the plaster with some kind of tool,
      flinging the pieces into a basket as they fell. Having now stripped clear
      about two feet area of wall, he inserted a crowbar between the joints of
      the bricks beneath, softly wriggling it until several were loosened. There
      was now disclosed the mouth of an old oven, which was apparently contrived
      in the thickness of the wall, and having fallen into disuse, had been
      closed up with bricks in this manner. It was formed after the simple
      old-fashioned plan of oven-building&mdash;a mere oblate cavity without a
      flue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston now stretched his arm into the oven, dragged forth a heavy weight
      of great bulk, and let it slide to the ground. The woman who watched him
      could see the object plainly. It was a common corn-sack, nearly full, and
      was tied at the mouth in the usual way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steward had once or twice started up, as if he had heard sounds, and
      his motions now became more cat-like still. On a sudden he put out the
      light. Anne had made no noise, yet a foreign noise of some kind had
      certainly been made in the intervening portion of the house. She heard it.
      'One of the rats,' she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed soon to recover from his alarm, but changed his tactics
      completely. He did not light his candle&mdash;going on with his work in
      the dark. She had only sounds to go by now, and, judging as well as she
      could from these, he was piling up the bricks which closed the oven's
      mouth as they had been before he disturbed them. The query that had not
      left her brain all the interval of her inspection&mdash;how should she get
      back into her bedroom again?&mdash;now received a solution. Whilst he was
      replacing the cupboard, she would glide across the brewhouse, take the key
      from the top of the copper, run upstairs, unlock the door, and bring back
      the key again: if he returned to bed, which was unlikely, he would think
      the lock had failed to catch in the staple. This thought and intention,
      occupying such length of words, flashed upon her in an instant, and hardly
      disturbed her strong curiosity to stay and learn the meaning of his
      actions in the workshop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slipping sideways through the first door and closing it behind her, she
      advanced into the darkness towards the second, making every individual
      footfall with the greatest care, lest the fragments of rubbish on the
      floor should crackle beneath her tread. She soon stood close by the
      copper, and not more than a foot from the door of the room occupied by
      Manston himself, from which position she could distinctly hear him breathe
      between each exertion, although it was far too dark to discern anything of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      To secure the key of her chamber was her first anxiety, and accordingly
      she cautiously reached out with her hand to where it lay. Instead of
      touching it, her fingers came in contact with the boot of a human being.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drooped faint in a cold sweat. It was the foot either of a man or
      woman, standing on the brewing-copper where the key had lain. A warm foot,
      covered with a polished boot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The startling discovery so terrified her that she could hardly repress a
      sound. She withdrew her hand with a motion like the flight of an arrow.
      Her touch was so light that the leather seemed to have been thick enough
      to keep the owner of the foot in entire ignorance of it, and the noise of
      Manston's scraping might have been quite sufficient to drown the slight
      rustle of her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The person was obviously not the steward: he was still busy. It was
      somebody who, since the light had been extinguished, had taken advantage
      of the gloom, to come from some dark recess in the brewhouse and stand
      upon the brickwork of the copper. The fear which had at first paralyzed
      her lessened with the birth of a sense that fear now was utter failure:
      she was in a desperate position and must abide by the consequences. The
      motionless person on the copper was, equally with Manston, quite
      unconscious of her proximity, and she ventured to advance her hand again,
      feeling behind the feet, till she found the key. On its return to her
      side, her finger-tip skimmed the lower verge of a trousers-leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a man, then, who stood there. To go to the door just at this time
      was impolitic, and she shrank back into an inner corner to wait. The
      comparative security from discovery that her new position ensured
      resuscitated reason a little, and empowered her to form some logical
      inferences:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      1. The man who stood on the copper had taken advantage of the darkness to
      get there, as she had to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The man must have been hidden in the outhouse before she had reached
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. He must be watching Manston with much calculation and system, and for
      purposes of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could now tell by the noises that Manston had completed his
      re-erection of the cupboard. She heard him replacing the articles it had
      contained&mdash;bottle by bottle, tool by tool&mdash;after which he came
      into the brewhouse, went to the window, and pulled down the cloths
      covering it; but the window being rather small, this unveiling scarcely
      relieved the darkness of the interior. He returned to the workshop,
      hoisted something to his back by a jerk, and felt about the room for some
      other article. Having found it, he emerged from the inner door, crossed
      the brewhouse, and went into the yard. Directly he stepped out she could
      see his outline by the light of the clouded and weakly moon. The sack was
      slung at his back, and in his hand he carried a spade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne now waited in her corner in breathless suspense for the proceedings
      of the other man. In about half-a-minute she heard him descend from the
      copper, and then the square opening of the doorway showed the outline of
      this other watcher passing through it likewise. The form was that of a
      broad-shouldered man enveloped in a long coat. He vanished after the
      steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman vented a sigh of relief, and moved forward to follow.
      Simultaneously, she discovered that the watcher whose foot she had touched
      was, in his turn, watched and followed also.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was by one of her own sex. Anne Seaway shrank backward again. The
      unknown woman came forward from the further side of the yard, and pondered
      awhile in hesitation. Tall, dark, and closely wrapped, she stood up from
      the earth like a cypress. She moved, crossed the yard without producing
      the slightest disturbance by her footsteps, and went in the direction the
      others had taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne waited yet another minute&mdash;then in her turn noiselessly followed
      the last woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      But so impressed was she with the sensation of people in hiding, that in
      coming out of the yard she turned her head to see if any person were
      following her, in the same way. Nobody was visible, but she discerned,
      standing behind the angle of the stable, Manston's horse and gig, ready
      harnessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did intend to fly after all, then, she thought. He must have placed the
      horse in readiness, in the interval between his leaving the house and her
      exit by the window. However, there was not time to weigh this branch of
      the night's events. She turned about again, and continued on the trail of
      the other three.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. FROM MIDNIGHT TO HALF-PAST ONE A.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intentness pervaded everything; Night herself seemed to have become a
      watcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four persons proceeded across the glade, and into the park plantation,
      at equidistances of about seventy yards. Here the ground, completely
      overhung by the foliage, was coated with a thick moss which was as soft as
      velvet beneath their feet. The first watcher, that is, the man walking
      immediately behind Manston, now fell back, when Manston's housekeeper,
      knowing the ground pretty well, dived circuitously among the trees and got
      directly behind the steward, who, encumbered with his load, had proceeded
      but slowly. The other woman seemed now to be about opposite to Anne, or a
      little in advance, but on Manston's other hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached a pit, midway between the waterfall and the engine-house. There
      he stopped, wiped his face, and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into this pit had drifted uncounted generations of withered leaves, half
      filling it. Oak, beech, and chestnut, rotten and brown alike, mingled
      themselves in one fibrous mass. Manston descended into the midst of them,
      placed his sack on the ground, and raking the leaves aside into a large
      heap, began digging. Anne softly drew nearer, crept into a bush, and
      turning her head to survey the rest, missed the man who had dropped
      behind, and whom we have called the first watcher. Concluding that he,
      too, had hidden himself, she turned her attention to the second watcher,
      the other woman, who had meanwhile advanced near to where Anne lay in
      hiding, and now seated herself behind a tree, still closer to the steward
      than was Anne Seaway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here and thus Anne remained concealed. The crunch of the steward's spade,
      as it cut into the soft vegetable mould, was plainly perceptible to her
      ears when the periodic cessations between the creaks of the engine
      concurred with a lull in the breeze, which otherwise brought the subdued
      roar of the cascade from the further side of the bank that screened it. A
      large hole&mdash;some four or five feet deep&mdash;had been excavated by
      Manston in about twenty minutes. Into this he immediately placed the sack,
      and then began filling in the earth, and treading it down. Lastly he
      carefully raked the whole mass of dead and dry leaves into the middle of
      the pit, burying the ground with them as they had buried it before.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a hiding-place the spot was unequalled. The thick accumulation of
      leaves, which had not been disturbed for centuries, might not be disturbed
      again for centuries to come, whilst their lower layers still decayed and
      added to the mould beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time this work was ended the sky had grown clearer, and Anne could
      now see distinctly the face of the other woman, stretching from behind the
      tree, seemingly forgetful of her position in her intense contemplation of
      the actions of the steward. Her countenance was white and motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible that Manston should not soon notice her. At the
      completion of his labour he turned, and did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ho&mdash;you here!' he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't think I am a spy upon you,' she said, in an imploring whisper. Anne
      recognized the voice as Miss Aldclyffe's.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trembling lady added hastily another remark, which was drowned in the
      recurring creak of the engine close at hand The first watcher, if he had
      come no nearer than his original position, was too far off to hear any
      part of this dialogue, on account of the roar of the falling water, which
      could reach him unimpeded by the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remark of Miss Aldclyffe to Manston had plainly been concerning the
      first watcher, for Manston, with his spade in his hand, instantly rushed
      to where the man was concealed, and, before the latter could disengage
      himself from the boughs, the steward struck him on the head with the blade
      of the instrument. The man fell to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Fly!' said Miss Aldclyffe to Manston. Manston vanished amidst the trees.
      Miss Aldclyffe went off in a contrary direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne Seaway was about to run away likewise, when she turned and looked at
      the fallen man. He lay on his face, motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of these women who own to no moral code show considerable magnanimity
      when they see people in trouble. To act right simply because it is one's
      duty is proper; but a good action which is the result of no law of
      reflection shines more than any. She went up to him and gently turned him
      over, upon which he began to show signs of life. By her assistance he was
      soon able to stand upright.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked about him with a bewildered air, endeavouring to collect his
      ideas. 'Who are you?' he said to the woman, mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was bad policy now to attempt disguise. 'I am the supposed Mrs.
      Manston,' she said. 'Who are you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am the officer employed by Mr. Raunham to sift this mystery&mdash;which
      may be criminal.' He stretched his limbs, pressed his head, and seemed
      gradually to awake to a sense of having been incautious in his utterance.
      'Never you mind who I am,' he continued. 'Well, it doesn't matter now,
      either&mdash;it will no longer be a secret.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He stooped for his hat and ran in the direction the steward had taken&mdash;coming
      back again after the lapse of a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's only an aggravated assault, after all,' he said hastily, 'until we
      have found out for certain what's buried here. It may be only a bag of
      building rubbish; but it may be more. Come and help me dig.' He seized the
      spade with the awkwardness of a town man, and went into the pit,
      continuing a muttered discourse. 'It's no use my running after him
      single-handed,' he said. 'He's ever so far off by this time. The best step
      is to see what is here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was far easier for the detective to re-open the hole than it had been
      for Manston to form it. The leaves were raked away, the loam thrown out,
      and the sack dragged forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hold this,' he said to Anne, whose curiosity still kept her standing
      near. He turned on the light of a dark lantern he had brought, and gave it
      into her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The string which bound the mouth of the sack was now cut. The officer laid
      the bag on its side, seized it by the bottom, and jerked forth the
      contents. A large package was disclosed, carefully wrapped up in
      impervious tarpaulin, also well tied. He was on the point of pulling open
      the folds at one end, when a light coloured thread of something, hanging
      on the outside, arrested his eye. He put his hand upon it; it felt
      stringy, and adhered to his fingers. 'Hold the light close,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held it close. He raised his hand to the glass, and they both peered
      at an almost intangible filament he held between his finger and thumb. It
      was a long hair; the hair of a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'God! I couldn't believe it&mdash;no, I couldn't believe it!' the
      detective whispered, horror-struck. 'And I have lost the man for the
      present through my unbelief. Let's get into a sheltered place.... Now wait
      a minute whilst I prove it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He thrust his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and withdrew thence a minute
      packet of brown paper. Spreading it out he disclosed, coiled in the
      middle, another long hair. It was the hair the clerk's wife had found on
      Manston's pillow nine days before the Carriford fire. He held the two
      hairs to the light: they were both of a pale-brown hue. He laid them
      parallel and stretched out his arms: they were of the same length to a
      nicety. The detective turned to Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is the body of his first wife,' he said quietly. 'He murdered her, as
      Mr. Springrove and the rector suspected&mdash;but how and when, God only
      knows.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I!' exclaimed Anne Seaway, a probable and natural sequence of events
      and motives explanatory of the whole crime&mdash;events and motives
      shadowed forth by the letter, Manston's possession of it, his renunciation
      of Cytherea, and instalment of herself&mdash;flashing upon her mind with
      the rapidity of lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah&mdash;I see,' said the detective, standing unusually close to her: and
      a handcuff was on her wrist. 'You must come with me, madam. Knowing as
      much about a secret murder as God knows is a very suspicious thing: it
      doesn't make you a goddess&mdash;far from it.' He directed the bull's-eye
      into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pooh&mdash;lead on,' she said scornfully, 'and don't lose your principal
      actor for the sake of torturing a poor subordinate like me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He loosened her hand, gave her his arm, and dragged her out of the grove&mdash;making
      her run beside him till they had reached the rectory. A light was burning
      here, and an auxiliary of the detective's awaiting him: a horse ready
      harnessed to a spring-cart was standing outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You have come&mdash;I wish I had known that,' the detective said to his
      assistant, hurriedly and angrily. 'Well, we've blundered&mdash;he's gone&mdash;you
      should have been here, as I said! I was sold by that woman, Miss Aldclyffe&mdash;she
      watched me.' He hastily gave directions in an undertone to this man. The
      concluding words were, 'Go in to the rector&mdash;he's up. Detain Miss
      Aldclyffe. I, in the meantime, am driving to Casterbridge with this one,
      and for help. We shall be sure to have him when it gets light.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He assisted Anne into the vehicle, and drove off with her. As they went,
      the clear, dry road showed before them, between the grassy quarters at
      each side, like a white riband, and made their progress easy. They came to
      a spot where the highway was overhung by dense firs for some distance on
      both sides. It was totally dark here.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a smash; and a rude shock. In the very midst of its length, at
      the point where the road began to drop down a hill, the detective drove
      against something with a jerk which nearly flung them both to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man recovered himself, placed Anne on the seat, and reached out his
      hand. He found that the off-wheel of his gig was locked in that of another
      conveyance of some kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hoy!' said the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hoy, you man asleep there!' he said again.
    </p>
    <p>
      No reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, that's odd&mdash;this comes of the folly of travelling without
      gig-lamps because you expect the dawn.' He jumped to the ground and turned
      on his lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the gig which had obstructed him, standing in the middle of the
      road; a jaded horse harnessed to it, but no human being in or near the
      vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you know whose gig this is?' he said to the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' she said sullenly. But she did recognize it as the steward's.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll swear it's Manston's! Come, I can hear it by your tone. However, you
      needn't say anything which may criminate you. What forethought the man
      must have had&mdash;how carefully he must have considered possible
      contingencies! Why, he must have got the horse and gig ready before he
      began shifting the body.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened for a sound among the trees. None was to be heard but the
      occasional scamper of a rabbit over the withered leaves. He threw the
      light of his lantern through a gap in the hedge, but could see nothing
      beyond an impenetrable thicket. It was clear that Manston was not many
      yards off, but the question was how to find him. Nothing could be done by
      the detective just then, encumbered as he was by the horse and Anne. If he
      had entered the thicket on a search unaided, Manston might have stepped
      unobserved from behind a bush and murdered him with the greatest ease.
      Indeed, there were such strong reasons for the exploit in Manston's
      circumstances at that moment that without showing cowardice, his pursuer
      felt it hazardous to remain any longer where he stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hastily tied the head of Manston's horse to the back of his own
      vehicle, that the steward might be deprived of the use of any means of
      escape other than his own legs, and drove on thus with his prisoner to the
      county-town. Arrived there, he lodged her in the police-station, and then
      took immediate steps for the capture of Manston.

    <h2>
      XX. THE EVENTS OF THREE HOURS
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1. MARCH THE TWENTY-THIRD. MIDDAY
    </h3>
    <p>
      Thirty-six hours had elapsed since Manston's escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was market-day at the county-town. The farmers outside and inside the
      corn-exchange looked at their samples of wheat, and poured them critically
      as usual from one palm to another, but they thought and spoke of Manston.
      Grocers serving behind their counters, instead of using their constant
      phrase, 'The next article, please?' substituted, 'Have you heard if he's
      caught?' Dairymen and drovers standing beside the sheep and cattle pens,
      spread their legs firmly, readjusted their hats, thrust their hands into
      the lowest depths of their pockets, regarded the animals with the utmost
      keenness of which the eye was capable, and said, 'Ay, ay, so's: they'll
      have him avore night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the day Edward Springrove passed along the street hurriedly and
      anxiously. 'Well, have you heard any more?' he said to an acquaintance who
      accosted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They tracked him in this way,' said the other young man. 'A vagrant first
      told them that Manston had passed a rick at daybreak, under which this man
      was lying. They followed the track he pointed out and ultimately came to a
      stile. On the other side was a heap of half-hardened mud, scraped from the
      road. On the surface of the heap, where it had been smoothed by the
      shovel, was distinctly imprinted the form of a man's hand, the buttons of
      his waistcoat, and his watch-chain, showing that he had stumbled in
      hurrying over the stile, and fallen there. The pattern of the chain proved
      the man to have been Manston. They followed on till they reached a ford
      crossed by stepping-stones&mdash;on the further bank were the same
      footmarks that had shown themselves beside the stile. The whole of this
      course had been in the direction of Budmouth. On they went, and the next
      clue was furnished them by a shepherd. He said that wherever a clear space
      three or four yards wide ran in a line through a flock of sheep lying
      about a ewe-lease, it was a proof that somebody had passed there not more
      than half-an-hour earlier. At twelve o'clock that day he had noticed such
      a feature in his flock. Nothing more could be heard of him, and they got
      into Budmouth. The steam-packet to the Channel Islands was to start at
      eleven last night, and they at once concluded that his hope was to get to
      France by way of Jersey and St. Malo&mdash;his only chance, all the
      railway-stations being watched.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, they went to the boat: he was not on board then. They went again at
      half-past ten: he had not come. Two men now placed themselves under the
      lamp immediately beside the gangway. Another stayed by the office door,
      and one or two more up Mary Street&mdash;the straight cut to the quay. At
      a quarter to eleven the mail-bags were put on board. Whilst the attention
      of the idlers was directed to the mails, down Mary Street came a man as
      boldly as possible. The gait was Manston's, but not the clothes. He passed
      over to the shaded part of the street: heads were turned. I suppose this
      warned him, for he never emerged from the shadow. They watched and waited,
      but the steward did not reappear. The alarm was raised&mdash;they searched
      the town high and low&mdash;no Manston. All this morning they have been
      searching, but there's not a sign of him anywhere. However, he has lost
      his last chance of getting across the Channel. It is reported that he has
      since changed clothes with a labourer.'
    </p>
    <p>
      During this narration, Edward, lost in thought, had let his eyes follow a
      shabby man in a smock-frock, but wearing light boots&mdash;who was
      stalking down the street under a bundle of straw which overhung and
      concealed his head. It was a very ordinary circumstance for a man with a
      bundle of straw on his shoulders and overhanging his head, to go down the
      High Street. Edward saw him cross the bridge which divided the town from
      the country, place his shaggy encumbrance by the side of the road, and
      leave it there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Springrove now parted from his acquaintance, and went also in the
      direction of the bridge, and some way beyond it. As far as he could see
      stretched the turnpike road, and, while he was looking, he noticed a man
      to leap from the hedge at a point two hundred, or two hundred and fifty
      yards ahead, cross the road, and go through a wicket on the other side.
      This figure seemed like that of the man who had been carrying the bundle
      of straw. He looked at the straw: it still stood alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subjoined facts sprang, as it were, into juxtaposition in his brain:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston had been seen wearing the clothes of a labouring man&mdash;a brown
      smock-frock. So had this man, who seemed other than a labourer, on second
      thoughts: and he had concealed his face by his bundle of straw with the
      greatest ease and naturalness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The path the man had taken led, among other places, to Tolchurch, where
      Cytherea was living.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mrs. Manston was murdered, as some said, on the night of the fire,
      Cytherea was the steward's lawful wife. Manston at bay, and reckless of
      results, might rush to his wife and harm her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a horrible supposition for a man who loved Cytherea to entertain;
      but Springrove could not resist its influence. He started off for
      Tolchurch.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. ONE TO TWO O'CLOCK P.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that self-same mid-day, whilst Edward was proceeding to Tolchurch by
      the footpath across the fields, Owen Graye had left the village and was
      riding along the turnpike road to the county-town, that he might ascertain
      the exact truth of the strange rumour which had reached him concerning
      Manston. Not to disquiet his sister, he had said nothing to her of the
      matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat by the window reading. From her position she could see up the lane
      for a distance of at least a hundred yards. Passers-by were so rare in
      this retired nook, that the eyes of those who dwelt by the wayside were
      invariably lifted to every one on the road, great and small, as to a
      novelty.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man in a brown smock-frock turned the corner and came towards the house.
      It being market-day at Casterbridge, the village was nearly deserted, and
      more than this, the old farm-house in which Owen and his sister were
      staying, stood, as has been stated, apart from the body of cottages. The
      man did not look respectable; Cytherea arose and bolted the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately he was near enough to see her cross the room. He advanced to
      the door, knocked, and, receiving no answer, came to the window; he next
      pressed his face against the glass, peering in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea's experience at that moment was probably as trying a one as ever
      fell to the lot of a gentlewoman to endure. She recognized in the peering
      face that of the man she had married.
    </p>
    <p>
      But not a movement was made by her, not a sound escaped her. Her fear was
      great; but had she known the truth&mdash;that the man outside, feeling he
      had nothing on earth to lose by any act, was in the last stage of
      recklessness, terrified nature must have given way.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cytherea,' he said, 'let me come in: I am your husband.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' she replied, still not realizing the magnitude of her peril. 'If you
      want to speak to us, wait till my brother comes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, he's not at home? Cytherea, I can't live without you! All my sin has
      been because I love you so! Will you fly with me? I have money enough for
      us both&mdash;only come with me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not now&mdash;not now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am your husband, I tell you, and I must come in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You cannot,' she said faintly. His words began to terrify her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will, I say!' he exclaimed. 'Will you let me in, I ask once more?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No&mdash;I will not,' said Cytherea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I will let myself in!' he answered resolutely. 'I will, if I die for
      it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The windows were glazed in lattice panes of leadwork, hung in casements.
      He broke one of the panes with a stone, thrust his hand through the hole,
      unfastened the latch which held the casement close, and began opening the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly the shutters flew together with a slam, and were barred with
      desperate quickness by Cytherea on the inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Damn you!' he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran round to the back of the house. His impatience was greater now: he
      thrust his fist through the pantry window at one blow, and opened it in
      the same way as the former one had been opened, before the terror-stricken
      girl was aware that he had gone round. In an instant he stood in the
      pantry, advanced to the front room where she was, flung back the shutters,
      and held out his arms to embrace her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In extremely trying moments of bodily or mental pain, Cytherea either
      flushed hot or faded pale, according to the state of her constitution at
      the moment. Now she burned like fire from head to foot, and this preserved
      her consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never before had the poor child's natural agility served her in such good
      stead as now. A heavy oblong table stood in the middle of the room. Round
      this table she flew, keeping it between herself and Manston, her large
      eyes wide open with terror, their dilated pupils constantly fixed upon
      Manston's, to read by his expression whether his next intention was to
      dart to the right or the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even he, at that heated moment, could not endure the expression of
      unutterable agony which shone from that extraordinary gaze of hers. It had
      surely been given her by God as a means of defence. Manston continued his
      pursuit with a lowered eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      The panting and maddened desperado&mdash;blind to everything but the
      capture of his wife&mdash;went with a rush under the table: she went over
      it like a bird. He went heavily over it: she flew under it, and was out at
      the other side.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     'One on her youth and pliant limbs relies,
      One on his sinews and his giant size.'
</pre>
    <p>
      But his superior strength was sure to tire her down in the long-run. She
      felt her weakness increasing with the quickness of her breath; she uttered
      a wild scream, which in its heartrending intensity seemed to echo for
      miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same juncture her hair became unfastened, and rolled down about her
      shoulders. The least accident at such critical periods is sufficient to
      confuse the overwrought intelligence. She lost sight of his intended
      direction for one instant, and he immediately outmanoeuvred her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'At last! my Cytherea!' he cried, overturning the table, springing over
      it, seizing one of the long brown tresses, pulling her towards him, and
      clasping her round. She writhed downwards between his arms and breast, and
      fell fainting on the floor. For the first time his action was leisurely.
      He lifted her upon the sofa, exclaiming, 'Rest there for a while, my
      frightened little bird!'
    </p>
    <p>
      And then there was an end of his triumph. He felt himself clutched by the
      collar, and whizzed backwards with the force of a battering-ram against
      the fireplace. Springrove, wild, red, and breathless, had sprung in at the
      open window, and stood once more between man and wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston was on his legs again in an instant. A fiery glance on the one
      side, a glance of pitiless justice on the other, passed between them. It
      was again the meeting in the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite: 'Hast thou
      found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found thee: because thou
      hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the Lord.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A desperate wrestle now began between the two men. Manston was the taller,
      but there was in Edward much hard tough muscle which the delicate flesh of
      the steward lacked. They flew together like the jaws of a gin. In a minute
      they were both on the floor, rolling over and over, locked in each other's
      grasp as tightly as if they had been one organic being at war with itself&mdash;Edward
      trying to secure Manston's arms with a small thong he had drawn from his
      pocket, Manston trying to reach his knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two characteristic noises pervaded the apartment through this momentous
      space of time. One was the sharp panting of the two combatants, so similar
      in each as to be undistinguishable; the other was the stroke of their
      heels and toes, as they smote the floor at every contortion of body or
      limbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea had not lost consciousness for more than half-a-minute. She had
      then leapt up without recognizing that Edward was her deliverer,
      unfastened the door, and rushed out, screaming wildly, 'Come! Help! O,
      help!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Three men stood not twenty yards off, looking perplexed. They dashed
      forward at her words. 'Have you seen a shabby man with a smock-frock on
      lately?' they inquired. She pointed to the door, and ran on the same as
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manston, who had just loosened himself from Edward's grasp, seemed at this
      moment to renounce his intention of pushing the conflict to a desperate
      end. 'I give it all up for life&mdash;dear life!' he cried, with a hoarse
      laugh. 'A reckless man has a dozen lives&mdash;see how I'll baffle you all
      yet!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He rushed out of the house, but no further. The boast was his last. In one
      half-minute more he was helpless in the hands of his pursuers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Edward staggered to his feet, and paused to recover breath. His thoughts
      had never forsaken Cytherea, and his first act now was to hasten up the
      lane after her. She had not gone far. He found her leaning upon a bank by
      the roadside, where she had flung herself down in sheer exhaustion. He ran
      up and lifted her in his arms, and thus aided she was enabled to stand
      upright&mdash;clinging to him. What would Springrove have given to imprint
      a kiss upon her lips then!
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked slowly towards the house. The distressing sensation of whose
      wife she was could not entirely quench the resuscitated pleasure he felt
      at her grateful recognition of him, and her confiding seizure of his arm
      for support. He conveyed her carefully into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour later, whilst she was sitting in a partially
      recovered, half-dozing state in an arm-chair, Edward beside her waiting
      anxiously till Graye should arrive, they saw a spring-cart pass the door.
      Old and dry mud-splashes from long-forgotten rains disfigured its wheels
      and sides; the varnish and paint had been scratched and dimmed; ornament
      had long been forgotten in a restless contemplation of use. Three men sat
      on the seat, the middle one being Manston. His hands were bound in front
      of him, his eyes were set directly forward, his countenance pallid, hard,
      and fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Springrove had told Cytherea of Manston's crime in a few short words. He
      now said solemnly, 'He is to die.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I cannot mourn for him,' she replied with a shudder, leaning back and
      covering her face with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the silence that followed the two short remarks, Springrove watched the
      cart round the corner, and heard the rattle of its wheels gradually dying
      away as it rolled in the direction of the county-town.

    <h2>
      XXI. THE EVENTS OF EIGHTEEN HOURS
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1. MARCH THE TWENTY-NINTH. NOON
    </h3>
    <p>
      Exactly seven days after Edward Springrove had seen the man with the
      bundle of straw walking down the streets of Casterbridge, old Farmer
      Springrove was standing on the edge of the same pavement, talking to his
      friend, Farmer Baker.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause in their discourse. Mr. Springrove was looking down the
      street at some object which had attracted his attention. 'Ah, 'tis what we
      shall all come to!' he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other looked in the same direction. 'True, neighbour Springrove;
      true.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Two men, advancing one behind the other in the middle of the road, were
      what the farmers referred to. They were carpenters, and bore on their
      shoulders an empty coffin, covered by a thin black cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I always feel a satisfaction at being breasted by such a sight as that,'
      said Springrove, still regarding the men's sad burden. 'I call it a sort
      of medicine.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And it is medicine.... I have not heard of any body being ill up this way
      lately? D'seem as if the person died suddenly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'May be so. Ah, Baker, we say sudden death, don't we? But there's no
      difference in their nature between sudden death and death of any other
      sort. There's no such thing as a random snapping off of what was laid down
      to last longer. We only suddenly light upon an end&mdash;thoughtfully
      formed as any other&mdash;which has been existing at that very same point
      from the beginning, though unseen by us to be so soon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It is just a discovery to your own mind, and not an alteration in the
      Lord's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's it. Unexpected is not as to the thing, but as to our sight.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now you'll hardly believe me, neighbour, but this little scene in front
      of us makes me feel less anxious about pushing on wi' that threshing and
      winnowing next week, that I was speaking about. Why should we not stand
      still, says I to myself, and fling a quiet eye upon the Whys and the
      Wherefores, before the end o' it all, and we go down into the
      mouldering-place, and are forgotten?'
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis a feeling that will come. But 'twont bear looking into. There's a
      back'ard current in the world, and we must do our utmost to advance in
      order just to bide where we be. But, Baker, they are turning in here with
      the coffin, look.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The two carpenters had borne their load into a narrow way close at hand.
      The farmers, in common with others, turned and watched them along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis a man's coffin, and a tall man's, too,' continued Farmer Springrove.
      'His was a fine frame, whoever he was.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A very plain box for the poor soul&mdash;just the rough elm, you see.'
      The corner of the cloth had blown aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, for a very poor man. Well, death's all the less insult to him. I
      have often thought how much smaller the richer class are made to look than
      the poor at last pinches like this. Perhaps the greatest of all the
      reconcilers of a thoughtful man to poverty&mdash;and I speak from
      experience&mdash;is the grand quiet it fills him with when the uncertainty
      of his life shows itself more than usual.'
    </p>
    <p>
      As Springrove finished speaking, the bearers of the coffin went across a
      gravelled square facing the two men and approached a grim and heavy
      archway. They paused beneath it, rang a bell, and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the archway was written in Egyptian capitals,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                           'COUNTY GAOL.'
</pre>
    <p>
      The small rectangular wicket, which was constructed in one of the two
      iron-studded doors, was opened from the inside. The men severally stepped
      over the threshold, the coffin dragged its melancholy length through the
      aperture, and both entered the court, and were covered from sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Somebody in the gaol, then?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, one of the prisoners,' said a boy, scudding by at the moment, who
      passed on whistling.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you know the name of the man who is dead?' inquired Baker of a third
      bystander.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, 'tis all over town&mdash;surely you know, Mr. Springrove? Why,
      Manston, Miss Aldclyffe's steward. He was found dead the first thing this
      morning. He had hung himself behind the door of his cell, in some way, by
      a handkerchief and some strips of his clothes. The turnkey says his
      features were scarcely changed, as he looked at 'em with the early sun
      a-shining in at the grating upon him. He has left a full account of the
      murder, and all that led to it. So there's an end of him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was perfectly true: Manston was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The previous day he had been allowed the use of writing-materials, and had
      occupied himself for nearly seven hours in preparing the following
      confession:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                         'LAST WORDS.
</pre>
    <p>
      'Having found man's life to be a wretchedly conceived scheme, I renounce
      it, and, to cause no further trouble, I write down the facts connected
      with my past proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      'After thanking God, on first entering my house, on the night of the fire
      at Carriford, for my release from bondage to a woman I detested, I went, a
      second time, to the scene of the disaster, and, finding that nothing could
      be done by remaining there, shortly afterwards I returned home again in
      the company of Mr. Raunham.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He parted from me at the steps of my porch, and went back towards the
      rectory. Whilst I still stood at the door, musing on my strange
      deliverance, I saw a figure advance from beneath the shadow of the park
      trees. It was the figure of a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'When she came near, the twilight was sufficient to show me her attire: it
      was a cloak reaching to the bottom of her dress, and a thick veil covering
      her face. These features, together with her size and gait, aided also by a
      flash of perception as to the chain of events which had saved her life,
      told me that she was my wife Eunice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I gnashed my teeth in a frenzy of despair; I had lost Cytherea; I had
      gained one whose beauty had departed, whose utterance was complaint, whose
      mind was shallow, and who drank brandy every day. The revulsion of feeling
      was terrible. Providence, whom I had just thanked, seemed a mocking
      tormentor laughing at me. I felt like a madman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She came close&mdash;started at seeing me outside&mdash;then spoke to me.
      Her first words were reproof for what I had unintentionally done, and
      sounded as an earnest of what I was to be cursed with as long as we both
      lived. I answered angrily; this tone of mine changed her complaints to
      irritation. She taunted me with a secret she had discovered, which
      concerned Miss Aldclyffe and myself. I was surprised to learn it&mdash;more
      surprised that she knew it, but concealed my feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"How could you serve me so?" she said, her breath smelling of spirits
      even then. "You love another woman&mdash;yes, you do. See how you drive me
      about! I have been to the station, intending to leave you for ever, and
      yet I come to try you once more."
    </p>
    <p>
      'An indescribable exasperation had sprung up in me as she talked&mdash;rage
      and regret were all in all. Scarcely knowing what I did, I furiously
      raised my hand and swung it round with my whole force to strike her. She
      turned quickly&mdash;and it was the poor creature's end. By her movement
      my hand came edgewise exactly in the nape of the neck&mdash;as men strike
      a hare to kill it. The effect staggered me with amazement. The blow must
      have disturbed the vertebrae; she fell at my feet, made a few movements,
      and uttered one low sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I ran indoors for water and some wine, I came out and lanced her arm with
      my penknife. But she lay still, and I found that she was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was a long time before I could realize my horrible position. For
      several minutes I had no idea of attempting to escape the consequences of
      my deed. Then a light broke upon me. Had anybody seen her since she left
      the Three Tranters? Had they not, she was already believed by the
      parishioners to be dust and ashes. I should never be found out.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Upon this I acted.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The first question was how to dispose of the body. The impulse of the
      moment was to bury her at once in the pit between the engine-house and
      waterfall; but it struck me that I should not have time. It was now four
      o'clock, and the working-men would soon be stirring about the place. I
      would put off burying her till the next night. I carried her indoors.
    </p>
    <p>
      'In turning the outhouse into a workshop, earlier in the season, I found,
      when driving a nail into the wall for fixing a cupboard, that the wall
      sounded hollow. I examined it, and discovered behind the plaster an old
      oven which had long been disused, and was bricked up when the house was
      prepared for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      'To unfix this cupboard and pull out the bricks was the work of a few
      minutes. Then, bearing in mind that I should have to remove the body again
      the next night, I placed it in a sack, pushed it into the oven, packed in
      the bricks, and replaced the cupboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I then went to bed. In bed, I thought whether there were any very remote
      possibilities that might lead to the supposition that my wife was not
      consumed by the flames of the burning house. The thing which struck me
      most forcibly was this, that the searchers might think it odd that no
      remains whatever should be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The clinching and triumphant deed would be to take the body and place it
      among the ruins of the destroyed house. But I could not do this, on
      account of the men who were watching against an outbreak of the fire. One
      remedy remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I arose again, dressed myself, and went down to the outhouse. I must take
      down the cupboard again. I did take it down. I pulled out the bricks,
      pulled out the sack, pulled out the corpse, and took her keys from her
      pocket and the watch from her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I then replaced everything as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      'With these articles in my pocket I went out of the yard, and took my way
      through the withy copse to the churchyard, entering it from the back. Here
      I felt my way carefully along till I came to the nook where pieces of
      bones from newly-dug graves are sometimes piled behind the laurel-bushes.
      I had been earnestly hoping to find a skull among these old bones; but
      though I had frequently seen one or two in the rubbish here, there was not
      one now. I then groped in the other corner with the same result&mdash;nowhere
      could I find a skull. Three or four fragments of leg and back-bones were
      all I could collect, and with these I was forced to be content.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Taking them in my hand, I crossed the road, and got round behind the inn,
      where the couch heap was still smouldering. Keeping behind the hedge, I
      could see the heads of the three or four men who watched the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Standing in this place I took the bones, and threw them one by one over
      the hedge and over the men's heads into the smoking embers. When the bones
      had all been thrown, I threw the keys; last of all I threw the watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I then returned home as I had gone, and went to bed once more, just as
      the dawn began to break. I exulted&mdash;"Cytherea is mine again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      'At breakfast-time I thought, "Suppose the cupboard should by some
      unlikely chance get moved to-day!"
    </p>
    <p>
      'I went to the mason's yard hard by, while the men were at breakfast, and
      brought away a shovelful of mortar. I took it into the outhouse, again
      shifted the cupboard, and plastered over the mouth of the oven behind.
      Simply pushing the cupboard back into its place, I waited for the next
      night that I might bury the body, though upon the whole it was in a
      tolerably safe hiding-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      'When the night came, my nerves were in some way weaker than they had been
      on the previous night. I felt reluctant to touch the body. I went to the
      outhouse, but instead of opening the oven, I firmly drove in the
      shoulder-nails that held the cupboard to the wall. "I will bury her
      to-morrow night, however," I thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But the next night I was still more reluctant to touch her. And my
      reluctance increased, and there the body remained. The oven was, after
      all, never likely to be opened in my time.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I married Cytherea Graye, and never did a bridegroom leave the church
      with a heart more full of love and happiness, and a brain more fixed on
      good intentions, than I did on that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      'When Cytherea's brother made his appearance at the hotel in Southampton,
      bearing his strange evidence of the porter's disclosure, I was staggered
      beyond expression. I thought they had found the body. "Am I to be
      apprehended and to lose her even now?" I mourned. I saw my error, and
      instantly saw, too, that I must act externally like an honourable man. So
      at his request I yielded her up to him, and meditated on several schemes
      for enabling me to claim the woman I had a legal right to claim as my
      wife, without disclosing the reason why I knew myself to have it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I went home to Knapwater the next day, and for nearly a week lived in a
      state of indecision. I could not hit upon a scheme for proving my wife
      dead without compromising myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr. Raunham hinted that I should take steps to discover her whereabouts
      by advertising. I had no energy for the farce. But one evening I chanced
      to enter the Rising Sun Inn. Two notorious poachers were sitting in the
      settle, which screened my entrance. They were half drunk&mdash;their
      conversation was carried on in the solemn and emphatic tone common to that
      stage of intoxication, and I myself was the subject of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The following was the substance of their disjointed remarks: On the night
      of the great fire at Carriford, one of them was sent to meet me, and break
      the news of the death of my wife to me. This he did; but because I would
      not pay him for his news, he left me in a mood of vindictiveness. When the
      fire was over, he joined his comrade. The favourable hour of the night
      suggested to them the possibility of some unlawful gain before daylight
      came. My fowlhouse stood in a tempting position, and still resenting his
      repulse during the evening, one of them proposed to operate upon my birds.
      I was believed to have gone to the rectory with Mr. Raunham. The other was
      disinclined to go, and the first went off alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was now about three o'clock. He had advanced as far as the shrubbery,
      which grows near the north wall of the house, when he fancied he heard,
      above the rush of the waterfall, noises on the other side of the building.
      He described them in these words, "Ghostly mouths talking&mdash;then a
      fall&mdash;then a groan&mdash;then the rush of the water and creak of the
      engine as before." Only one explanation occurred to him; the house was
      haunted. And, whether those of the living or the dead, voices of any kind
      were inimical to one who had come on such an errand. He stealthily crept
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      'His unlawful purpose in being behind the house led him to conceal his
      adventure. No suspicion of the truth entered his mind till the
      railway-porter had startled everybody by his strange announcement. Then he
      asked himself, had the horrifying sounds of that night been really an
      enactment in the flesh between me and my wife?
    </p>
    <p>
      'The words of the other man were:
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Why don't he try to find her if she's alive?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"True," said the first. "Well, I don't forget what I heard, and if she
      don't turn up alive my mind will be as sure as a Bible upon her murder,
      and the parson shall know it, though I do get six months on the treadmill
      for being where I was."
    </p>
    <p>
      '"And if she should turn up alive?"
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Then I shall know that I am wrong, and believing myself a fool as well
      as a rogue, hold my tongue."
    </p>
    <p>
      'I glided out of the house in a cold sweat. The only pressure in heaven or
      earth which could have forced me to renounce Cytherea was now put upon me&mdash;the
      dread of a death upon the gallows.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I sat all that night weaving strategy of various kinds. The only
      effectual remedy for my hazardous standing that I could see was a simple
      one. It was to substitute another woman for my wife before the suspicions
      of that one easily-hoodwinked man extended further.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The only difficulty was to find a practicable substitute.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The one woman at all available for the purpose was a friendless, innocent
      creature, named Anne Seaway, whom I had known in my youth, and who had for
      some time been the housekeeper of a lady in London. On account of this
      lady's sudden death, Anne stood in rather a precarious position, as
      regarded her future subsistence. She was not the best kind of woman for
      the scheme; but there was no alternative. One quality of hers was
      valuable; she was not a talker. I went to London the very next day, called
      at the Hoxton lodging of my wife (the only place at which she had been
      known as Mrs. Manston), and found that no great difficulties stood in the
      way of a personation. And thus favouring circumstances determined my
      course. I visited Anne Seaway, made love to her, and propounded my plan.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      'We lived quietly enough until the Sunday before my apprehension. Anne
      came home from church that morning, and told me of the suspicious way in
      which a young man had looked at her there. Nothing could be done beyond
      waiting the issue of events. Then the letter came from Raunham. For the
      first time in my life I was half indifferent as to what fate awaited me.
      During the succeeding day I thought once or twice of running away, but
      could not quite make up my mind. At any rate it would be best to bury the
      body of my wife, I thought, for the oven might be opened at any time. I
      went to Casterbridge and made some arrangements. In the evening Miss
      Aldclyffe (who is united to me by a common secret which I have no right or
      wish to disclose) came to my house, and alarmed me still more. She said
      that she could tell by Mr. Raunham's manner that evening, that he kept
      back from her a suspicion of more importance even than the one he spoke
      of, and that strangers were in his house even then.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I guessed what this further suspicion was, and resolved to enlighten her
      to a certain extent, and so secure her assistance. I said that I killed my
      wife by an accident on the night of the fire, dwelling upon the advantage
      to her of the death of the only woman who knew her secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Her terror, and fears for my fate, led her to watch the rectory that
      evening. She saw the detective leave it, and followed him to my residence.
      This she told me hurriedly when I perceived her after digging my wife's
      grave in the plantation. She did not suspect what the sack contained.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am now about to enter on my normal condition. For people are almost
      always in their graves. When we survey the long race of men, it is strange
      and still more strange to find that they are mainly dead men, who have
      scarcely ever been otherwise.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                              'AENEAS MANSTON.'
</pre>
    <p>
      The steward's confession, aided by circumstantial evidence of various
      kinds, was the means of freeing both Anne Seaway and Miss Aldclyffe from
      all suspicion of complicity with the murderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. SIX O'CLOCK P.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evening&mdash;just at sunset&mdash;on the day of Manston's death.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the cottage at Tolchurch was gathered a group consisting of Cytherea,
      her brother, Edward Springrove, and his father. They sat by the window
      conversing of the strange events which had just taken place. In Cytherea's
      eye there beamed a hopeful ray, though her face was as white as a lily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst they talked, looking out at the yellow evening light that coated
      the hedges, trees, and church tower, a brougham rolled round the corner of
      the lane, and came in full view. It reflected the rays of the sun in a
      flash from its polished panels as it turned the angle, the spokes of the
      wheels bristling in the same light like bayonets. The vehicle came nearer,
      and arrived opposite Owen's door, when the driver pulled the rein and gave
      a shout, and the panting and sweating horses stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Aldclyffe's carriage!' they all exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen went out. 'Is Miss Graye at home?' said the man. 'A note for her, and
      I am to wait for an answer.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea read in the handwriting of the Rector of Carriford:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'DEAR MISS GRAYE,&mdash;Miss Aldclyffe is ill, though not dangerously. She
      continually repeats your name, and now wishes very much to see you. If you
      possibly can, come in the carriage.&mdash;Very sincerely yours, JOHN
      RAUNHAM.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How comes she ill?' Owen inquired of the coachman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She caught a violent cold by standing out of doors in the damp, on the
      night the steward ran away. Ever since, till this morning, she complained
      of fulness and heat in the chest. This morning the maid ran in and told
      her suddenly that Manston had killed himself in gaol&mdash;she shrieked&mdash;broke
      a blood-vessel&mdash;and fell upon the floor. Severe internal haemorrhage
      continued for some time and then stopped. They say she is sure to get over
      it; but she herself says no. She has suffered from it before.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea was ready in a few moments, and entered the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. SEVEN O'CLOCK P.M.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soft as was Cytherea's motion along the corridors of Knapwater House, the
      preternaturally keen intelligence of the suffering woman caught the
      maiden's well-known footfall. She entered the sick-chamber with suspended
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the room everything was so still, and sensation was as it were so
      rarefied by solicitude, that thinking seemed acting, and the lady's weak
      act of trying to live a silent wrestling with all the powers of the
      universe. Nobody was present but Mr. Raunham, the nurse having left the
      room on Cytherea's entry, and the physician and surgeon being engaged in a
      whispered conversation in a side-chamber. Their patient had been
      pronounced out of danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea went to the bedside, and was instantly recognized. O, what a
      change&mdash;Miss Aldclyffe dependent upon pillows! And yet not a
      forbidding change. With weakness had come softness of aspect: the
      haughtiness was extracted from the frail thin countenance, and a sweeter
      mild placidity had taken its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe signified to Mr. Raunham that she would like to be alone
      with Cytherea.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cytherea?' she faintly whispered the instant the door was closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea clasped the lady's weak hand, and sank beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe whispered again. 'They say I am certain to live; but I know
      that I am certainly going to die.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'They know, I think, and hope.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know best, but we'll leave that. Cytherea&mdash;O Cytherea, can you
      forgive me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her companion pressed her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you don't know yet&mdash;you don't know yet,' the invalid murmured.
      'It is forgiveness for that misrepresentation to Edward Springrove that I
      implore, and for putting such force upon him&mdash;that which caused all
      the train of your innumerable ills!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know all&mdash;all. And I do forgive you. Not in a hasty impulse that
      is revoked when coolness comes, but deliberately and sincerely: as I
      myself hope to be forgiven, I accord you my forgiveness now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Tears streamed from Miss Aldclyffe's eyes, and mingled with those of her
      young companion, who could not restrain hers for sympathy. Expressions of
      strong attachment, interrupted by emotion, burst again and again from the
      broken-spirited woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you don't know my motive. O, if you only knew it, how you would pity
      me then!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea did not break the pause which ensued, and the elder woman
      appeared now to nerve herself by a superhuman effort. She spoke on in a
      voice weak as a summer breeze, and full of intermission, and yet there
      pervaded it a steadiness of intention that seemed to demand firm tones to
      bear it out worthily.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cytherea,' she said, 'listen to me before I die.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A long time ago&mdash;more than thirty years ago&mdash;a young girl of
      seventeen was cruelly betrayed by her cousin, a wild officer of
      six-and-twenty. He went to India, and died.
    </p>
    <p>
      'One night when that miserable girl had just arrived home with her parents
      from Germany, where her baby had been born, she took all the money she
      possessed, pinned it on her infant's bosom, together with a letter,
      stating, among other things, what she wished the child's Christian name to
      be; wrapped up the little thing, and walked with it to Clapham. Here, in a
      retired street, she selected a house. She placed the child on the doorstep
      and knocked at the door, then ran away and watched. They took it up and
      carried it indoors.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now that her poor baby was gone, the girl blamed herself bitterly for
      cruelty towards it, and wished she had adopted her parents' counsel to
      secretly hire a nurse. She longed to see it. She didn't know what to do.
      She wrote in an assumed name to the woman who had taken it in, and asked
      her to meet the writer with the infant at certain places she named. These
      were hotels or coffee-houses in Chelsea, Pimlico, or Hammersmith. The
      woman, being well paid, always came, and asked no questions. At one
      meeting&mdash;at an inn in Hammersmith&mdash;she made her appearance
      without the child, and told the girl it was so ill that it would not live
      through the night. The news, and fatigue, brought on a fainting-fit....'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe's sobs choked her utterance, and she became painfully
      agitated. Cytherea, pale and amazed at what she heard, wept for her, bent
      over her, and begged her not to go on speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes&mdash;I must,' she cried, between her sobs. 'I will&mdash;I must go
      on! And I must tell yet more plainly!... you must hear it before I am
      gone, Cytherea.' The sympathizing and astonished girl sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The name of the woman who had taken the child was <i>Manston</i>. She was
      the widow of a schoolmaster. She said she had adopted the child of a
      relation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Only one man ever found out who the mother was. He was the keeper of the
      inn in which she fainted, and his silence she has purchased ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A twelvemonth passed&mdash;fifteen months&mdash;and the saddened girl met
      a man at her father's house named Graye&mdash;your father, Cytherea, then
      unmarried. Ah, such a man! Inexperience now perceived what it was to be
      loved in spirit and in truth! But it was too late. Had he known her secret
      he would have cast her out. She withdrew from him by an effort, and pined.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Years and years afterwards, when she became mistress of a fortune and
      estates by her father's death, she formed the weak scheme of having near
      her the son whom, in her father's life-time, she had been forbidden to
      recognize. Cytherea, you know who that weak woman is.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      'By such toilsome labour as this I got him here as my steward. And I
      wanted to see him <i>your husband</i>, Cytherea!&mdash;the husband of my
      true lover's child. It was a sweet dream to me.... Pity me&mdash;O, pity
      me! To die unloved is more than I can bear! I loved your father, and I
      love him now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the burden of Cytherea Aldclyffe.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose you must leave me again&mdash;you always leave me,' she said,
      after holding the young woman's hand a long while in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No&mdash;indeed I'll stay always. Do you like me to stay?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Aldclyffe in the jaws of death was Miss Aldclyffe still, though the
      old fire had degenerated to mere phosphorescence now. 'But you are your
      brother's housekeeper?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, of course you cannot stay with me on a sudden like this.... Go
      home, or he will be at a loss for things. And to-morrow morning come
      again, won't you, dearest, come again&mdash;we'll fetch you. But you
      mustn't stay now, and put Owen out. O no&mdash;it would be absurd.' The
      absorbing concern about trifles of daily routine, which is so often seen
      in very sick people, was present here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea promised to go home, and come the next morning to stay
      continuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Stay till I die then, will you not? Yes, till I die&mdash;I shan't die
      till to-morrow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We hope for your recovery&mdash;all of us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know best. Come at six o'clock, darling.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'As soon as ever I can,' returned Cytherea tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But six is too early&mdash;you will have to think of your brother's
      breakfast. Leave Tolchurch at eight, will you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea consented to this. Miss Aldclyffe would never have known had her
      companion stayed in the house all night; but the honesty of Cytherea's
      nature rebelled against even the friendly deceit which such a proceeding
      would have involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      An arrangement was come to whereby she was to be taken home in the
      pony-carriage instead of the brougham that fetched her; the carriage to
      put up at Tolchurch farm for the night, and on that account to be in
      readiness to bring her back earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. MARCH THE THIRTIETH. DAYBREAK
    </p>
    <p>
      The third and last instance of Cytherea's subjection to those periodic
      terrors of the night which had emphasized her connection with the
      Aldclyffe name and blood occurred at the present date.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about four o'clock in the morning when Cytherea, though most
      probably dreaming, seemed to awake&mdash;and instantly was transfixed by a
      sort of spell, that had in it more of awe than of affright. At the foot of
      her bed, looking her in the face with an expression of entreaty beyond the
      power of words to portray, was the form of Miss Aldclyffe&mdash;wan and
      distinct. No motion was perceptible in her; but longing&mdash;earnest
      longing&mdash;was written in every feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cytherea believed she exercised her waking judgment as usual in thinking,
      without a shadow of doubt, that Miss Aldclyffe stood before her in flesh
      and blood. Reason was not sufficiently alert to lead Cytherea to ask
      herself how such a thing could have occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I would have remained with you&mdash;why would you not allow me to stay!'
      Cytherea exclaimed. The spell was broken: she became broadly awake; and
      the figure vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the grey time of dawn. She trembled in a sweat of disquiet, and
      not being able to endure the thought of her brother being asleep, she went
      and tapped at his door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Owen!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not a heavy sleeper, and it was verging upon his time to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do you want, Cytherea?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I ought not to have left Knapwater last night. I wish I had not. I really
      think I will start at once. She wants me, I know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What time is it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A few minutes past four.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You had better not. Keep to the time agreed upon. Consider, we should
      have such a trouble in rousing the driver, and other things.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the whole it seemed wiser not to act on a mere fancy. She went to bed
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, when Owen was thinking of getting up, a knocking came to
      the front door. The next minute something touched the glass of Owen's
      window. He waited&mdash;the noise was repeated. A little gravel had been
      thrown against it to arouse him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the room, pulled up the blind, and looked out. A solemn white
      face was gazing upwards from the road, expectantly straining to catch the
      first glimpse of a person within the panes. It was the face of a Knapwater
      man sitting on horseback.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen saw his errand. There is an unmistakable look in the face of every
      man who brings tidings of death. Graye opened the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Aldclyffe....' said the messenger, and paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah&mdash;dead?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes&mdash;she is dead.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'When did she die?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'At ten minutes past four, after another effusion. She knew best, you see,
      sir. I started directly, by the rector's orders.'

    <h2>
      SEQUEL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fifteen months have passed, and we are brought on to Midsummer Night,
      1867.
    </p>
    <p>
      The picture presented is the interior of the old belfry of Carriford
      Church, at ten o'clock in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six Carriford men and one stranger are gathered there, beneath the light
      of a flaring candle stuck on a piece of wood against the wall. The six
      Carriford men are the well-known ringers of the fine-toned old bells in
      the key of F, which have been music to the ears of Carriford parish and
      the outlying districts for the last four hundred years. The stranger is an
      assistant, who has appeared from nobody knows where.
    </p>
    <p>
      The six natives&mdash;in their shirt-sleeves, and without hats&mdash;pull
      and catch frantically at the dancing bellropes, the locks of their hair
      waving in the breeze created by their quick motions; the stranger, who has
      the treble bell, does likewise, but in his right mind and coat. Their
      ever-changing shadows mingle on the wall in an endless variety of
      kaleidoscopic forms, and the eyes of all the seven are religiously fixed
      on a diagram like a large addition sum, which is chalked on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vividly contrasting with the yellow light of the candle upon the four
      unplastered walls of the tower, and upon the faces and clothes of the men,
      is the scene discernible through the screen beneath the tower archway. At
      the extremity of the long mysterious avenue of the nave and chancel can be
      seen shafts of moonlight streaming in at the east window of the church&mdash;blue,
      phosphoric, and ghostly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thorough renovation of the bell-ringing machinery and accessories had
      taken place in anticipation of an interesting event. New ropes had been
      provided; every bell had been carefully shifted from its carriage, and the
      pivots lubricated. Bright red 'sallies' of woollen texture&mdash;soft to
      the hands and easily caught&mdash;glowed on the ropes in place of the old
      ragged knots, all of which newness in small details only rendered more
      evident the irrepressible aspect of age in the mass surrounding them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The triple-bob-major was ended, and the ringers wiped their faces and
      rolled down their shirt-sleeves, previously to tucking away the ropes and
      leaving the place for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Piph&mdash;h&mdash;h&mdash;h! A good forty minutes,' said a man with a
      streaming face, and blowing out his breath&mdash;one of the pair who had
      taken the tenor bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Our friend here pulled proper well&mdash;that 'a did&mdash;seeing he's
      but a stranger,' said Clerk Crickett, who had just resigned the second
      rope, and addressing the man in the black coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''A did,' said the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I enjoyed it much,' said the man modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What we should ha' done without you words can't tell. The man that
      d'belong by rights to that there bell is ill o' two gallons o' wold
      cider.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And now so's,' remarked the fifth ringer, as pertaining to the last
      allusion, 'we'll finish this drop o' metheglin and cider, and every man
      home&mdash;along straight as a line.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wi' all my heart,' Clerk Crickett replied. 'And the Lord send if I ha'n't
      done my duty by Master Teddy Springrove&mdash;that I have so.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And the rest o' us,' they said, as the cup was handed round.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay, ay&mdash;in ringen&mdash;but I was spaken in a spiritual sense o'
      this mornen's business o' mine up by the chancel rails there. 'Twas very
      convenient to lug her here and marry her instead o' doen it at that
      twopenny-halfpenny town o' Budm'th. Very convenient.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very. There was a little fee for Master Crickett.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah&mdash;well. Money's money&mdash;very much so&mdash;very&mdash;I always
      have said it. But 'twas a pretty sight for the nation. He coloured up like
      any maid, that 'a did.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well enough 'a mid colour up. 'Tis no small matter for a man to play wi'
      fire.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whatever it may be to a woman,' said the clerk absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thou'rt thinken o' thy wife, clerk,' said Gad Weedy. 'She'll play wi'it
      again when thou'st got mildewed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well&mdash;let her, God bless her; for I'm but a poor third man, I. The
      Lord have mercy upon the fourth!... Ay, Teddy's got his own at last. What
      little white ears that maid hev, to be sure! choose your wife as you
      choose your pig&mdash;a small ear and a small tale&mdash;that was always
      my joke when I was a merry feller, ah&mdash;years agone now! But Teddy's
      got her. Poor chap, he was getten as thin as a hermit wi' grief&mdash;so
      was she.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Maybe she'll pick up now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'True&mdash;'tis nater's law, which no man shall gainsay. Ah, well do I
      bear in mind what I said to Pa'son Raunham, about thy mother's family o'
      seven, Gad, the very first week of his comen here, when I was just in my
      prime. "And how many daughters has that poor Weedy got, clerk?" he says.
      "Six, sir," says I, "and every one of 'em has a brother!" "Poor woman,"
      says he, "a dozen children!&mdash;give her this half-sovereign from me,
      clerk." 'A laughed a good five minutes afterwards, when he found out my
      merry nater&mdash;'a did. But there, 'tis over wi' me now. Enteren the
      Church is the ruin of a man's wit for wit's nothen without a faint shadder
      o' sin.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If so be Teddy and the lady had been kept apart for life, they'd both ha'
      died,' said Gad emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But now instead o' death there'll be increase o' life,' answered the
      clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It all went proper well,' said the fifth bell-ringer. 'They didn't flee
      off to Babylonish places&mdash;not they.' He struck up an attitude&mdash;'Here's
      Master Springrove standen so: here's the married woman standen likewise;
      here they d'walk across to Knapwater House; and there they d'bide in the
      chimley corner, hard and fast.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, 'twas a pretty wedden, and well attended,' added the clerk. 'Here
      was my lady herself&mdash;red as scarlet: here was Master Springrove,
      looken as if he half wished he'd never a-come&mdash;ah, poor souls!&mdash;the
      men always do! The women do stand it best&mdash;the maid was in her glory.
      Though she was so shy the glory shone plain through that shy skin. Ah, it
      did so's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ay,' said Gad, 'and there was Tim Tankins and his five journeymen
      carpenters, standen on tiptoe and peepen in at the chancel winders. There
      was Dairyman Dodman waiten in his new spring-cart to see 'em come out&mdash;whip
      in hand&mdash;that 'a was. Then up comes two master tailors. Then there
      was Christopher Runt wi' his pickaxe and shovel. There was wimmen-folk and
      there was men-folk traypsen up and down church'ard till they wore a path
      wi' traypsen so&mdash;letten the squallen children slip down through their
      arms and nearly skinnen o' em. And these were all over and above the
      gentry and Sunday-clothes folk inside. Well, I seed Mr. Graye at last
      dressed up quite the dand. "Well, Mr. Graye," says I from the top o'
      church'ard wall, "how's yerself?" Mr. Graye never spoke&mdash;he'd prided
      away his hearen. Seize the man, I didn' want en to spak. Teddy hears it,
      and turns round: "All right, Gad!" says he, and laughed like a boy.
      There's more in Teddy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' said Clerk Crickett, turning to the man in black, 'now you've been
      among us so long, and d'know us so well, won't ye tell us what ye've come
      here for, and what your trade is?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am no trade,' said the thin man, smiling, 'and I came to see the
      wickedness of the land.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I said thou wast one o' the devil's brood wi' thy black clothes,' replied
      a sturdy ringer, who had not spoken before.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, the truth is,' said the thin man, retracting at this horrible
      translation, 'I came for a walk because it is a fine evening.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now let's be off, neighbours,' the clerk interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The candle was inverted in the socket, and the whole party stepped out
      into the churchyard. The moon was shining within a day or two of full, and
      just overlooked the three or four vast yews that stood on the south-east
      side of the church, and rose in unvaried and flat darkness against the
      illuminated atmosphere behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good-night,' the clerk said to his comrades, when the door was locked.
      'My nearest way is through the park.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose mine is too?' said the stranger. 'I am going to the
      railway-station.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course&mdash;come on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men went over a stile to the west, the remainder of the party
      going into the road on the opposite side.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And so the romance has ended well,' the clerk's companion remarked, as
      they brushed along through the grass. 'But what is the truth of the story
      about the property?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now look here, neighbour,' said Clerk Crickett, 'if so be you'll tell me
      what your line o' life is, and your purpose in comen here to-day, I'll
      tell you the truth about the wedden particulars.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well&mdash;I will when you have done,' said the other man.
    </p>
    <p>
      ''Tis a bargain; and this is the right o' the story. When Miss Aldclyffe's
      will was opened, it was found to have been drawn up on the very day that
      Manston (her love-child) married Miss Cytherea Graye. And this is what
      that deep woman did. Deep? she was as deep as the North Star. She
      bequeathed all her property, real and personal, to "THE WIFE OF AENEAS
      MANSTON" (with one exception): failen her life to her husband: failen his
      life to the heirs of his head&mdash;body I would say: failen them to her
      absolutely and her heirs for ever: failen these to Pa'son Raunham, and so
      on to the end o' the human race. Now do you see the depth of her scheme?
      Why, although upon the surface it appeared her whole property was for Miss
      Cytherea, by the word "wife" being used, and not Cytherea's name, whoever
      was the wife o' Manston would come in for't. Wasn't that rale depth? It
      was done, of course, that her son AEneas, under any circumstances, should
      be master o' the property, without folk knowen it was her son or
      suspecting anything, as they would if it had been left to en straightway.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A clever arrangement! And what was the exception?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The payment of a legacy to her relative, Pa'son Raunham.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And Miss Cytherea was now Manston's widow and only relative, and
      inherited all absolutely.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'True, she did. "Well," says she, "I shan't have it" (she didn't like the
      notion o' getten anything through Manston, naturally enough, pretty dear).
      She waived her right in favour o' Mr. Raunham. Now, if there's a man in
      the world that d'care nothen about land&mdash;I don't say there is, but <i>if</i>
      there is&mdash;'tis our pa'son. He's like a snail. He's a-growed so to the
      shape o' that there rectory that 'a wouldn' think o' leaven it even in
      name. "'Tis yours, Miss Graye," says he. "No, 'tis yours," says she.
      "'Tis'n' mine," says he. The Crown had cast his eyes upon the case,
      thinken o' forfeiture by felony&mdash;but 'twas no such thing, and 'a gied
      it up, too. Did you ever hear such a tale?&mdash;three people, a man and a
      woman, and a Crown&mdash;neither o' em in a madhouse&mdash;flingen an
      estate backwards and forwards like an apple or nut? Well, it ended in this
      way. Mr. Raunham took it: young Springrove was had as agent and steward,
      and put to live in Knapwater House, close here at hand&mdash;just as if
      'twas his own. He does just what he'd like&mdash;Mr. Raunham never
      interferen&mdash;and hither to-day he's brought his new wife, Cytherea.
      And a settlement ha' been drawn up this very day, whereby their children,
      heirs, and cetrer, be to inherit after Mr. Raunham's death. Good fortune
      came at last. Her brother, too, is doen well. He came in first man in some
      architectural competition, and is about to move to London. Here's the
      house, look. Stap out from these bushes, and you'll get a clear sight
      o't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They emerged from the shrubbery, breaking off towards the lake, and down
      the south slope. When they arrived exactly opposite the centre of the
      mansion, they halted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a magnificent picture of the English country-house. The whole of
      the severe regular front, with its columns and cornices, was built of a
      white smoothly-faced freestone, which appeared in the rays of the moon as
      pure as Pentelic marble. The sole objects in the scene rivalling the
      fairness of the facade were a dozen swans floating upon the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the central door at the top of the steps was opened, and
      two figures advanced into the light. Two contrasting figures were they. A
      young lithe woman in an airy fairy dress&mdash;Cytherea Springrove: a
      young man in black stereotype raiment&mdash;Edward, her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood at the top of the steps together, looking at the moon, the
      water, and the general loveliness of the prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's the married man and wife&mdash;there, I've illustrated my story by
      rale liven specimens,' the clerk whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'To be sure, how close together they do stand! You couldn' slip a
      penny-piece between 'em&mdash;that you couldn'! Beautiful to see it, isn't
      it&mdash;beautiful!... But this is a private path, and we won't let 'em
      see us, as all the ringers be goen there to a supper and dance to-morrow
      night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaker and his companion softly moved on, passed through the wicket,
      and into the coach-road. Arrived at the clerk's house at the further
      boundary of the park, they paused to part.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now for your half o' the bargain,' said Clerk Crickett. 'What's your line
      o' life, and what d'ye come here for?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm the reporter to the Casterbridge Chronicle, and I come to pick up the
      news. Good-night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Edward and Cytherea, after lingering on the steps for several
      minutes, slowly descended the slope to the lake. The skiff was lying
      alongside.
    </p>
    <p>
      'O, Edward,' said Cytherea, 'you must do something that has just come into
      my head!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, dearest&mdash;I know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes&mdash;give me one half-minute's row on the lake here now, just as you
      did on Budmouth Bay three years ago.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He handed her into the boat, and almost noiselessly pulled off from shore.
      When they were half-way between the two margins of the lake, he paused and
      looked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, darling, I remember exactly how I kissed you that first time,' said
      Springrove. 'You were there as you are now. I unshipped the sculls in this
      way. Then I turned round and sat beside you&mdash;in this way. Then I put
      my hand on the other side of your little neck&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think it was just on my cheek, in this way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ah, so it was. Then you moved that soft red mouth round to mine&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, dearest&mdash;you pressed it round if you remember; and of course I
      couldn't then help letting it come to your mouth without being unkind to
      you, and I wouldn't be that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And then I put my cheek against that cheek, and turned my two lips round
      upon those two lips, and kissed them&mdash;so.'
    </p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
